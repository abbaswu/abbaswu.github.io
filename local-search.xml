Personally, I recommend installing <a href="https://lftp.yar.ru/"><code>lftp</code></a>, a “sophisticated” file transfer program. Unlike a standard FTP Client, which only enables you to upload or download files, <code>lftp</code> additionally enables you to maintain file synchronisation using its built-in <code>mirror</code> command.</p><h2 id="Setting-Up-the-Machine-With-the-FTP-Server"><a href="#Setting-Up-the-Machine-With-the-FTP-Server" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up the Machine With the FTP Server"></a>Setting Up the Machine With the FTP Server</h2><p>We would also need an FTP Server on the other Machine. Although there are many existing UNIX FTP servers, such as <code>proftpd</code> and <code>vsftpd</code>, they are usually tricky to compile, configure, and set up and require Root Privileges to run, which is tedious, if not impossible, in many situations.</p><p>As an alternative, we write our own FTP Server using <a href="https://github.com/giampaolo/pyftpdlib"><code>pyftpdlib</code></a>, a pure Python FTP server library written which offers a high-level interface to creating portable and efficient FTP servers. Such a solution requires us to have a Python environment running on the Machine With the FTP Server and install <code>pyftpdlib</code>, which is very simple in today’s world where the Python ecosystem is ubiquitous.</p><p>After setting up a Python environment and installing <code>pyftpdlib</code>, we can write a script for an FTP server. Below is the script that I am using. By default, it sets up a user <code>user</code> with password <code>12345</code> and listens on port <code>2121</code> of the Machine With the FTP Server’s Outbound IP Address, but these settings can all be tweaked by providing command-line arguments.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Chapter 15, “Subtyping,” describes adding Subtyping with Functions and Records into Simply Typed Lambda Calculus. It formalizes the Subtype Relation as a collection of Inference Rules, verifies that verify that the Preservation and Progress Theorems of Simply Typed Lambda Calculus still apply, examines Ascription (or Casting) in the context of Subtyping, and proposes Subtyping Rules for Variants, Lists, References, and Arrays. Finally, it presents alternative Coercion Semantics for Subtyping. Chapter 16, “Metatheory of Subtyping,” observes that the Subtyping Rules presented in the previous chapter are not syntax-directed and have overlapping conclusions, which impedes implementing a Typechecking Algorithm, and develops the Algorithmic Subtype Relation and the Algorithmic Typing Relation to address these problems.</p><h1 id="Critique"><a href="#Critique" class="headerlink" title="Critique"></a>Critique</h1><h2 id="Acquired-Insights"><a href="#Acquired-Insights" class="headerlink" title="Acquired Insights"></a>Acquired Insights</h2><p>I will first summarize the insights that I gained while reading these Chapters.</p><p>An empty Bottom Type is useful, both as a way of expressing that a Function is not intended to return and telling the Typechecker that the Term can be associated with any Type.</p><p>Implementing Ascription (Casting) in Subtyping is non-trivial, especially for Downcasting. As blindly following Type Assertions may lead to potentially serious consequences, the Compiler would need to insert a Runtime Type Check, essentially adding the Machinery for Typechecking to the Runtime System. This might incur a significant performance overhead.</p><p>Different from an Inheritance Based Class Hierarchy, which is a physical relationship between Types, Subtyping generally is more of a <em>logical relationship</em> between Types. For example, in the alternative Coercion Semantics for Subtyping, we can consider that <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>, two Types that do not inherit from one another, have a Subtyping Relation, as they can be converted to one another. In this case, the Subtyping Relation is compiled to Coercions at runtime (instructions physically converting an <code>int</code> to a <code>float</code>, or vice versa), which are much more efficient than virtual function calls frequently seen in an Inheritance Based Class Hierarchy.</p><h2 id="Background-Knowledge"><a href="#Background-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="Background Knowledge"></a>Background Knowledge</h2><p>There is no doubt that the Chapters are written in great detail. However, I find some of the content, especially the terminology, a little difficult to understand, and I have looked into background knowledge concerning the topic. Below summarizes what I have read.</p><h3 id="Polymorphism"><a href="#Polymorphism" class="headerlink" title="Polymorphism"></a>Polymorphism</h3><p>Polymorphism describes that a single Interface can work with Terms of Different Types in Programming Languages. There are different kinds of Polymorphism in the context of Programming Languages, including:</p><h4 id="Parametric-Polymorphism"><a href="#Parametric-Polymorphism" class="headerlink" title="Parametric Polymorphism"></a>Parametric Polymorphism</h4><p>Also known as “Generic Programming”. Using Abstract Symbols that can substitute for any Type instead of specifying Concrete Types in Interfaces. C++’s Template Metaprogramming comes close to Parametric Polymorphism (except for Template Specializations).</p><h4 id="Ad-Hoc-Polymorphism"><a href="#Ad-Hoc-Polymorphism" class="headerlink" title="Ad Hoc Polymorphism"></a>Ad Hoc Polymorphism</h4><p>Defining a Common Interface for a Set of Individually Specified Types. Includes Function Overloading, Operator Overloading, and C++’s Template Metaprogramming with Template Specializations.</p><h4 id="Subtyping"><a href="#Subtyping" class="headerlink" title="Subtyping"></a>Subtyping</h4><p>It is a form of Polymorphism in which the Terms of a Subtype <code>T</code>, which is related to another Type known as the Supertype <code>T&#39;</code> in some way, can be safely used in any Context where the Terms of <code>T&#39;</code> are used.</p><p>The Concept of Subtyping has gained visibility with the advent of Object Oriented Programming Languages, where it is frequently the case that an Inheritance Based Class Hierarchy forms the basis of Subtyping, and such Safe Substitution is known as the Liskov Substitution Principle.</p><p>However, stepping out of this specific and widely known context, there are several different Schemes of Subtyping. They can be broadly classified along two dimensions: Nominal Subtyping vs. Structural Subtyping and Inclusive Implementations vs. Coercive Implementations.</p><p>Nominal Subtyping requires the Subtyping Relation to be explicitly declared among the two Types. This is the case with the Subtyping based on an Inheritance Based Class Hierarchy frequently encountered in Object Oriented Programming Languages. In contrast, in Structural Subtyping, a Type <code>T</code> is <strong>implicitly</strong> the Subtype of another Type <code>T&#39;</code> if Terms of <code>T</code> has all the Properties of Terms of <code>T&#39;</code> and can handle all the Messages Terms of <code>T&#39;</code> can handle. This is closely related to Row Polymorphism or the so-called Duck Typing in Dynamically Typed Programming Languages.</p><p>On another dimension, Implementations of Subtyping can be divided into Inclusive Implementations and Coercive Implementations. In Inclusive Implementations, any Term of a Subtype, left unchanged, is <strong>automatically</strong> a Term of a Supertype. This is often the case with the Subtyping based on an Inheritance Based Class Hierarchy frequently encountered in Object Oriented Programming Languages. A Term can have multiple Types in this situation. In contrast, Coercive Implementations are defined by <strong>Type Conversion Functions</strong> from Subtype to Supertype and allow a Term of a Subtype to be <strong>converted</strong> to a Term of a Supertype, such as the case for <code>int</code>‘s, <code>float</code>‘s, and <code>str</code>‘s. It is also worth noticing that applying the Type Coercion Function from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> and then from <code>B</code> to <code>C</code> might have a different result from directly applying the Type Coercion Function from <code>A</code> to <code>C</code>. For example, <code>str(float(2))</code> returns a value different from <code>str(2)</code>.</p><p>Based on the concept of Subtyping, the concept of Variance reference to how the Subtyping Relations between more complex Types relates to the Subtyping Relations between the simpler Types they include. For example, given that <code>Cat</code> is a Subtype of <code>Animal</code>, should a List of <code>Cat</code>‘s be a Subtype of a List of <code>Animal</code>‘s? What about a Function that takes a Term of Type <code>Cat</code> as an Arugument and a Function that takes a Term of Type <code>Animal</code> as an Arugument?</p><p>Different Programming Languages have different implementations, but most Programming Languages respect the following patterns.</p><ul><li>If the Complex Types are <strong>Read Only and&#x2F;or capable of returning Terms of the Simple Types</strong>, they should have the <strong>same</strong> Subtyping Relations as the Simple Types. This is known as <strong>Covariance</strong>. For example,<ul><li>A read-only List of <code>Cat</code>‘s can be used whenever a read-only List of <code>Animal</code>‘s is required, as each Term read from the read-only List of <code>Cat</code>‘s is of Type <code>Cat</code>, which is a Subtype of <code>Animal</code>. In other words, <code>const List&lt;Cat&gt;</code> <em>is</em> a Subtype of <code>const List&lt;Animal&gt;</code>.</li><li>It is not safe to use a <code>const List&lt;Animal&gt;</code> where a <code>const List&lt;Cat&gt;</code> is required, as a Term read from a <code>const List&lt;Animal&gt;</code> may not be of Type <code>Cat</code>. In other words, <code>const List&lt;Animal&gt;</code> <em>is not</em> a Subtype of <code>const List&lt;Cat&gt;</code>.</li></ul></li><li>If the Complex Types are <strong>Write Only and&#x2F;or capable of accepting Terms of the Simple Types as Parameters</strong>, they should have the <strong>opposite</strong> Subtyping Relations as the Simple Types. This is known as <strong>Contravariance</strong>. For example,<ul><li>A Function that takes a Term of Type <code>Animal</code> as a Parameter may be used where a Function that takes a Term of Type <code>Cat</code> as a Parameter is used, as each Term of Type <code>Cat</code> can also be passed as a Parameter of Type <code>Animal</code>. In other words, <code>Animal -&gt; T</code> <em>is</em> a Subtype of <code>Cat -&gt; T</code>.</li><li>It is not safe to use a <code>Cat -&gt; T</code> where an <code>Animal -&gt; T</code> is required, as a Term of Type <code>Animal</code> may not be passed as a Parameter of Type <code>Cat</code>. In other words, <code>Cat -&gt; T</code> <em>is not</em> a Subtype of <code>Animal -&gt; T</code>.</li></ul></li><li>If the Complex Types are <strong>Read&#x2F;Write</strong>, they should have <strong>no</strong> Subtying Relations. This is known as <strong>Invariance</strong>. For example,<ul><li>A Term written into a <code>List&lt;Animal&gt;</code> need not be of Type <code>Cat</code>, but a Term written into a (non-constant) <code>List&lt;Cat&gt;</code> <em>must</em> be of Type <code>Cat</code>. Thus, it is not safe to use a <code>List&lt;Cat&gt;</code> where a <code>List&lt;Animal&gt;</code> is required.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Chapters 13 and 14 of “Types and Programming Languages” discuss adding Impure Features, also known as Computational Effects, into Simply Typed Lambda Calculus. Specifically, Chapter 13 discusses adding References to Mutable Cells that can be Allocated, Dereferenced, and Assigned and formalizes their Operational Behavior. Chapter 14 gradually adds Raising and Handling Exceptions, starting from a Term <code>error</code> of any Type that completely aborts Evaluation when applied as a Function or passed as an Argument to a Function, before supporting Exception Handling, as well as Raising a Value (potentially containing information about what unusual thing happened) as an Exception.</p><h1 id="Critique"><a href="#Critique" class="headerlink" title="Critique"></a>Critique</h1><p>Overall, I believe these two Chapters are written very well, as they progressively add realistic features to Simply Typed Lambda Calculus. I will summarize takeaways from this paper before presenting some questions and comments.</p><h2 id="Takeaways-From-This-Paper"><a href="#Takeaways-From-This-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways From This Paper"></a>Takeaways From This Paper</h2><h3 id="References-to-Mutable-Cells"><a href="#References-to-Mutable-Cells" class="headerlink" title="References to Mutable Cells"></a>References to Mutable Cells</h3><p>The Formalization of the Operational Behavior of References to Mutable Cells encompasses Allocations (providing an initial value to a Mutable Cell), Dereferences (reading the current value of the referenced Cell), and Assignments (changing the value stored in the referenced Cell), but not Deallocations. Explicit Deallocations lead to the Dangling Reference Problem, which undermines Type Safety. Instead, References to Mutable Cells that are no longer needed should be Garbage Collected.</p><p>An interpretation of how Aliasing makes Program Analysis tricky is that Aliasing essentially sets up “Implicit Communication Channels in the form of Shared State” between different parts of a Program.</p><p>To formalize the Operational Behavior of References to Mutable Cells, we can consider a Reference $l \in L$, where $L$ is the set of Locations of the Program’s Store (a.k.a. Heap Memory) $\mu$.</p><p>As the result of Evaluating an Expression depends on the current contents of the Store and may cause Side Effects for the Store, Evaluation Rules should, in addition to Terms and Types, take the Store as an Argument and return a new Store as part of the result of Evaluating an Expression.</p><p>Furthermore, in a naive implementation of Typing Rules for References to Mutable Cells, the Type of the Reference depends on the Type of the Mutable Cell, e.g., $\frac{\Gamma \vdash \mu(l): T}{\Gamma \vdash l: \text{Ref} : T}$. However, this is inefficient where there are multiple levels of Indirection and is problematic where there are Cyclic References. To solve this problem, the Chapter proposes extending Typing Rules with a Store Typing $\Sigma$, which maps every Location $l \in L$ to a fixed, definite Type. In this case, the Typing Rule is written as $\frac{\Gamma | \Sigma \vdash \Sigma(l): T}{\Gamma | \Sigma \vdash l: \text{Ref} : T}$.</p><h3 id="Raising-and-Handling-Exceptions"><a href="#Raising-and-Handling-Exceptions" class="headerlink" title="Raising and Handling Exceptions"></a>Raising and Handling Exceptions</h3><p>The first (and most straightforward) Approach to Raising and Handling Exceptions, a Term <code>error</code> that completely aborts Evaluation when applied as a Function or passed as an Argument to a Function, effectively simulates Unwinding the Call Stack when it propagates <code>error</code> to the top level.</p><p>The final approach that supports both Exception Handling and Raising a Value as an Exception considers an Exception to be a Value $t_{exp}$ of Type $T_{exp}$ (instead of a Term <code>error</code>). It proposes a Term Constructor <code>raise t_&#123;exp&#125;</code> that describes Raising a Value as an Exception, and models Exception Handling with <code>try t_1 with t_2: T_1</code>, in which $t_1: T_1$ and $t_2: T_{exp} \rightarrow T_1$ (i.e., $t_2$ is a function, called when an Exception is Raised, taking a Raised Exception as Input and Returning a Value of the same Type as $t_1$ as Output). </p><h2 id="Questions-and-Comments"><a href="#Questions-and-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Questions and Comments"></a>Questions and Comments</h2><p>After reading these two Chapters, the power of Functions as a Universal Abstraction has left a deep impression on me. For example:</p><ul><li>Arrays containing Terms of Type $T$ can be modeled as References to Functions of type $Nat \rightarrow T$. The Referenced Function looks up the Element given an Index.</li><li>Exception Handling is modeled with <code>try t_1 with t_2</code>, in which $t_2$ is a function called when an Exception is Raised, taking a Raised Exception as Input and Returning a Value of the same Type as $t_1$ as Output).</li></ul><p>This describes complex Side Effects in a realistic Programming Language in a Side Effect Free manner that is clean and easy to reason about while not sacrificing Expressiveness. Are there any other complex Side Effects that can be modeled like this using Functions?</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NOTE: This is a Paper Review for <a href="https://williamjbowman.com/teaching/2022/w2/cpsc539b/">Topics in Programming Languages: Type Systems</a>.

It presents a motivating example of this using a Simply Typed Lambda Calculus having Bool and Function as Types and Bool Constants, Variables, Function Abstractions, Function Applications, and Conditional Expressions as Terms, in which the Typing Rule for Function Abstractions cannot be directly translated into a Function for Type Inference.</p><p>It then presents Bidirectional Typing as a remedy to this problem. It explains what Bidirectional Typing is, discusses its advantage, and adds Bidirectional Typing into the previously presented Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, presenting how Bidirectional Typing works during the process.</p><p>Finally, it discusses the limitations of Bidirectional Typing and presents academic literature for further reading.</p><h1 id="Critique"><a href="#Critique" class="headerlink" title="Critique"></a>Critique</h1><p>Overall, I believe this paper is written very well, as I can grasp most of it after reading it. I will summarize my takeaways from this paper before presenting some questions and comments.</p><h2 id="My-Takeaways-From-This-Paper"><a href="#My-Takeaways-From-This-Paper" class="headerlink" title="My Takeaways From This Paper"></a>My Takeaways From This Paper</h2><h3 id="What-Bidirectional-Typing-Is"><a href="#What-Bidirectional-Typing-Is" class="headerlink" title="What Bidirectional Typing Is"></a>What Bidirectional Typing Is</h3><p>Bidirectional Typing splits each Typing Rule $\Gamma \vdash t: T$ into:</p><ul><li>An Inference Rule $\Gamma \vdash t \Rightarrow T$, which <em>infers</em> $t$’s type to be $T$ in Context $\Gamma$.</li><li>A Type Checking Rule $\Gamma \vdash t \Leftarrow T$, which <em>checks</em> $t$’s type to be $T$ in Context $\Gamma$.</li></ul><p>The Inference Rules and Type Checking Rules would work together and call each other.</p><h3 id="Advantages-of-Bidirectional-Typing"><a href="#Advantages-of-Bidirectional-Typing" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Bidirectional Typing"></a>Advantages of Bidirectional Typing</h3><ul><li>Makes general Typing Rules more Syntax Directed, thus, simplifying implementing Algorithms for Type Checking and Type Inference.</li><li>Requires relatively few additional Type Annotations.</li><li>Produces good error messages that report where the error occurs.</li></ul><h3 id="Limitations-of-Bidirectional-Typing"><a href="#Limitations-of-Bidirectional-Typing" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Bidirectional Typing"></a>Limitations of Bidirectional Typing</h3><ul><li>Variables in a Derivation can no longer be replaced by the Derivation for a Term of the same Type. This is because Bidirectional Typing uses Inference Mode to check Variables but uses Checking Mode to check many other Terms.</li><li>In some situations, explicit Type Annotations may need to be written within complex Terms, such as a direct Application of a Function Abstraction, like <code>(λ b . if b then false else true) true: Bool</code></li></ul><h2 id="Questions-and-Comments"><a href="#Questions-and-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Questions and Comments"></a>Questions and Comments</h2><ul><li>Page 8 mentions, “remember that the derivation, like the bidirectional typing rules, should be read bottom-to-top and left-to-right.” However, Inference Rules have the form of $\frac{Premise}{Conclusion}$. So, why should the derivation be read from Conclusion to Premise?</li><li>What are the meanings of the small-step rule $\frac{}{t : T \rightarrow t}$ and the large-step rule $\frac{t \Downarrow t’}{t : T \Downarrow t’}$ on Page 8?</li><li>I believe explicit Type Annotations should be enforced for the Parameters within Function Abstractions, such as <code>(λ b: Bool . if b then false else true)</code> instead of <code>(λ b . if b then false else true)</code>.<ul><li>This aligns with real-world programming languages (C++, Java, Rust, Swift, Haskell, etc.)</li><li>This increases readability.</li><li>This simplifies both the Typing Rules and the Inference Rules and Type Checking Rules of Bidirectional Typing.</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="Feedback-from-the-Class-Discussion"><a href="#Feedback-from-the-Class-Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Feedback from the Class Discussion"></a>Feedback from the Class Discussion</h1><p>Small Step Semantics, represented using $\rightarrow$’s, depict <strong>one step in Evaluation</strong>. For example, if $e$ is $true$ itself, $\text{if}: e : \text{then} : e_1 : \text{else} : e_2$ can be Evaluated <strong>in one step</strong> to $e_1$. This can be represented using $\frac{e \rightarrow true}{\text{if}: e : \text{then} : e_1 : \text{else} : e_2 \rightarrow e_1}$</p><p>Big Step Semantics, represented using $\Downarrow$’s, depict <strong>Reducing a Subexpression to a Value through several Small Steps</strong>. For example, if $e$ is a Subexpression that can be Reduced to $true$ after several Small Steps, $\text{if}: e : \text{then} : e_1 : \text{else} : e_2$ can be Reduced to $e_1$ <strong>after several Small Steps</strong>. This can be represented using $\frac{e \Downarrow true}{\text{if}: e : \text{then} : e_1 : \text{else} : e_2 \Downarrow e_1}$.</p><p>Syntax Directed means a one-to-one correspondence between the Type of the Term and the Syntax (Derivation of the Grammar Rules) of the Term.</p><p>There is no precise definition for Bidirectional Typing. Instead, Bidirectional Typing points a direction toward implementing a Type Inference&#x2F;Type Checking Algorithm.</p><p>In Bidirectional Typing, we prefer to start from Inference Mode because if we can Infer the Type of a Term, we can Check the Type of the Term, while Checking falls back on Inference.</p><p>Why is there only a Checking Rule and no Inference Rule for <code>if t then t else t</code>?</p><ul><li>This gives better error messages.<ul><li>Should the Terms in the <code>then</code> branch and the <code>else</code> branch have different types, it is possible to give an error message directly stating this information.</li><li>If an Inference Rule had been proposed instead, it would blame one branch for having a wrong type, which may be confusing and go against programmer intent.</li></ul></li></ul><p>We can read Typing Rules either from top to bottom or from bottom to top, with slightly different interpretations.</p><ul><li>Reading from top to bottom describes how to use the information for Type Checking.</li><li>Reading from bottom to top describes how a Type Inference Algorithm works, e.g., what needs to be Checked to Infer the Type of a Term.</li></ul><p>From a historical perspective, there are two Design Philosophies for Type Systems.</p><ul><li>The first is to augment a Programming Language with more information, such as C which uses it to determine how much space a variable would take up in memory.</li><li>The second is to express programmer intent.</li></ul><p>Type Annotations (Ascriptions) for Parameters are required for Functions that are not immediately used, such as Top Level Functions. However, it is helpful to omit Type Annotations (Ascriptions) for Parameters for immediately used Lambda Terms within Higher Order Functions.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Paper Review: &quot;Types and Programming Languages&quot; Chapter 9 and Chapter 11</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Chapter 9 of “Types and Programming Languages” presents the simply typed lambda calculus, which constructs a type system for pure lambda calculus, explaining theoretical aspects such as the typing relation and the Curry-Howard Correspondence along the way.</p><p>Chapter 11 introduces simple extensions to the simply typed lambda calculus presented in Chapter 9, such as base types, derived forms, type ascriptions, let bindings, and some compound data structures (pairs, tuples, records, sums, variants, and lists), making it better resemble a real-world programming language.</p><h1 id="Critique"><a href="#Critique" class="headerlink" title="Critique"></a>Critique</h1><h2 id="Foreword"><a href="#Foreword" class="headerlink" title="Foreword"></a>Foreword</h2><p>I have found the textbook hard to follow in many places. Thus, I have followed the textbook and looked into many online resources to grasp the content. Below summarizes my understanding after studying the material.</p><h2 id="Basic-Concepts-in-Type-Theory"><a href="#Basic-Concepts-in-Type-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Basic Concepts in Type Theory"></a>Basic Concepts in Type Theory</h2><h3 id="Terms-and-Types"><a href="#Terms-and-Types" class="headerlink" title="Terms and Types"></a>Terms and Types</h3><p>In Type Theory, every Term has a Type, often written together as <code>&lt;Term&gt;: &lt;Type&gt;</code>. Types include Natural Numbers (<code>nat</code>) and Boolean Logic Values (<code>bool</code>). For example (assuming <code>x: nat</code> and <code>y: nat</code>):</p><ul><li><code>0: nat</code></li><li><code>x: nat</code></li><li><code>1 + 1: nat</code></li><li><code>x + y: nat</code></li><li><code>true: bool</code></li><li><code>x + y: nat</code></li></ul><h3 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" class="headerlink" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h3><p>Functions are also Terms with Types, represented as Lambda Terms.</p><p>A Lambda Term looks like <code>(λ &lt;First Parameter Name&gt;: &lt;First Parameter Type&gt; &lt;Second Parameter Name&gt;: &lt;Second Parameter Type&gt; ... . &lt;Term to Return&gt;)</code>.</p><p>It has type <code>&lt;First Parameter Type&gt; → &lt;Second Parameter Type&gt; → ... → &lt;Type of Term to Return&gt;</code>. This indicates that the Lambda Term is a function that takes Parameters of <code>&lt;First Parameter Type&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Second Parameter Type&gt;</code>, etc., and returns a Term of <code>&lt;Type of Term to Return&gt;</code>.</p><p>Examples of Lambda Terms:</p><ul><li><code>(λ x: nat . (x + x)): nat → nat</code>: a Function which takes in a Parameter <code>x</code> of Type <code>nat</code> and returns the doubled Parameter.</li><li><code>(λ x: nat y: nat . (x + y)): nat → nat → nat</code>: a Function which takes in two Parameters <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> all of Type <code>nat</code> and returns their sum.</li></ul><p>A Lambda Term is often called an Anonymous Function because it has no Name. We can use the notion to give a Name to a Lambda Term:</p><ul><li><code>add: nat → nat → nat ::= (λ x: nat y: nat . (x + y))</code></li></ul><h3 id="Function-Applications"><a href="#Function-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Function Applications"></a>Function Applications</h3><p>In Type Theory, a Function Call is called a Function Application, which “takes a Term of a Type and results in a Term of another Type.” Function Application is written as <code>&lt;Function&gt; &lt;Argument&gt; &lt;Argument&gt; ...</code> (akin to Function Calls in Haskell and Commands in Unix Shell) instead of the conventional <code>&lt;Function&gt;(&lt;Argument&gt;, &lt;Argument&gt;, ...)</code> in Programming Languages.</p><p>If we define a Function <code>add</code> that takes two <code>nat</code>‘s and returns a <code>nat</code>, the following are valid Terms:</p><ul><li><code>add 0 0: nat</code></li><li><code>add 2 3: nat</code></li><li><code>add 1 (add 1 (add 1 0)): nat</code></li></ul><h3 id="Dependent-Typing"><a href="#Dependent-Typing" class="headerlink" title="Dependent Typing"></a>Dependent Typing</h3><p>Sometimes, the Type returned by a Function depends on the Value of its Argument. This is known as Dependent Typing. </p><p>For example, a function <code>if</code> takes three arguments, with <code>if true b c</code> returning <code>b</code>, and  <code>if false b c</code> returning <code>c</code>. If <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> have different Types, then the type of <code>if</code> depends on the value of <code>a</code>.</p><p>Dependent Typing is a reasonably complicated subject that is an active domain of research.</p><h3 id="Zero-Type-Unit-Type-and-Universal-Type"><a href="#Zero-Type-Unit-Type-and-Universal-Type" class="headerlink" title="Zero Type, Unit Type, and Universal Type"></a>Zero Type, Unit Type, and Universal Type</h3><h4 id="Zero-Type"><a href="#Zero-Type" class="headerlink" title="Zero Type"></a>Zero Type</h4><p>In some programming languages, there is a <strong>Zero Type</strong> or <strong>Bottom Type</strong> - a Type whose Set of Terms is the empty set and a Subtype of all other Types.</p><p>In these programming languages, denoting the Zero Type as a Function’s Return Type frequently indicates that <strong>the Function never returns (never completes computation) - instead, it may loop forever, throw an exception, or terminate the process</strong>.</p><p>As a real-world example, in Rust, the Zero Type is called the Never Type and is denoted by !. It is the kind of calculation that never returns any result. For example, the exit function <code>fn exit(code: i32) -&gt; !</code> terminates the process without returning.</p><h4 id="Unit-Type"><a href="#Unit-Type" class="headerlink" title="Unit Type"></a>Unit Type</h4><p>In some programming languages, the <strong>Unit Type</strong> is a Type whose Set of Terms is a singleton set, i.e., the type allows only one value. <strong>It is typically used to describe the Argument Type of a Function that doesn’t need arguments or the Return Type of a Function whose only goal is to have a side effect.</strong> For example:</p><ul><li>In Haskell, Rust, and Elm, the Unit Type is the Type of the 0-tuple <code>()</code>.</li><li>In Python, the Unit Type is <code>NoneType</code>, which only has a single instance <code>None</code>.</li><li>In JavaScript, both <code>Null</code> (which only has a single instance <code>null</code>) and <code>Undefined</code> (which only has a single instance <code>undefined</code>) are Unit Types.</li></ul><p>In languages such as C, C++, Java, and C#, <code>void</code>, which designates that a Function accepts no Arguments or does not return anything, plays a similar role to the Unit Type. However, there are also key differences:</p><ul><li>There are no Terms (Instances) of <code>void</code>.</li><li>A proper Unit Type may always be the Type of an Argument to a Function, but <code>void</code> cannot be the Type of an Argument.</li></ul><h4 id="Universal-Type"><a href="#Universal-Type" class="headerlink" title="Universal Type"></a>Universal Type</h4><p>Most object-oriented programming languages include a universal base class. In Type Theory, this is known as a <strong>Universal Type</strong> or a <strong>Top Type</strong>. Its Set of Terms encompasses any valid Term in the programming language, and all other types in the programming language are subtypes. For example:</p><ul><li><code>Object</code> in Smalltalk and JavaScript</li><li><code>java.lang.Object</code> in Java</li><li><code>System.Object</code> in C#, Visual Basic .NET, and other .NET Framework languages</li><li><code>object</code> in Python (can also be type-annotated as <code>typing.Any</code>)</li><li><code>Any</code> in Scala and Julia</li></ul><p>Some object-oriented programming languages, such as C++, Objective-C, and Swift, do not have a universal base class. In these languages, some constructs function similarly to the Universal Type.</p><ul><li>In C++, <code>void *</code> can accept any non-function pointer (even though <code>void</code> itself is more akin to the Unit Type).</li><li>In Objective-C, <code>id</code> can accept pointers to any object.</li><li>In Swift, the protocol <code>Any</code> can accept any type.</li></ul><p>Languages that are not object-oriented usually do not have a Universal Type.</p><h3 id="Typing-Context"><a href="#Typing-Context" class="headerlink" title="Typing Context"></a>Typing Context</h3><p>A Typing Context (or Typing Environment) $\Gamma$ is a Mapping from Terms to Types (or a collection of Term - Type Pairs). The judgement $\Gamma \vdash e: \tau$ is read as “$e$ has type $\tau$ in Context $\Gamma$”.</p><p>In Statically Typed Programming Languages, these Typing Contexts are used and maintained by Typing Rules to Type Check a given Program or Expression.</p><h3 id="Type-Inhabitation"><a href="#Type-Inhabitation" class="headerlink" title="Type Inhabitation"></a>Type Inhabitation</h3><p>Given a Typing Environment, a Type is <strong>inhabitated</strong> if an existing Term of the Type is available or a Term of the Type can be readily obtained (i.e., via Function Application).</p><h3 id="Derived-Forms"><a href="#Derived-Forms" class="headerlink" title="Derived Forms"></a>Derived Forms</h3><p>In Type Theory, Syntactic Sugar is known as <strong>Derived Forms</strong>, while replacing a Derived Form with its lower-level definition (usually during compile time) is known as <strong>desugaring</strong>. For example:</p><ul><li>In C, <code>a[i]</code> and <code>*(a + 1)</code>, <code>a-&gt;x</code> and <code>(*a).x</code>.</li><li>In the tidyverse collection of R packages, <code>x %&gt;% f(y)</code> is equivalent to <code>f(x, y)</code>.</li></ul><p>A programming language is typically divided into a compact core language, <strong>a rich set of syntax defined in terms of that core (Derived Forms)</strong>, and a comprehensive standard library. This makes the language maintainable for engineers while making it convenient for users.</p><h3 id="Type-Ascription"><a href="#Type-Ascription" class="headerlink" title="Type Ascription"></a>Type Ascription</h3><p><strong>Type Ascription</strong> is an assertion within source code that a term has a particular type. This can lead to cleaner, easier-to-understand code documentation. </p><h2 id="Important-Derived-Forms"><a href="#Important-Derived-Forms" class="headerlink" title="Important Derived Forms"></a>Important Derived Forms</h2><ul><li>Tuple</li><li>Record (Struct, Rows in a Database) - a collection of Fields, possibly of different Types</li><li>Variant (Datatype, Tagged Union, Discriminated Union, Disjoint Union)<ul><li>A data structure to hold a Term that could take on “several different, but fixed Types.”</li><li>Contains a Value field and a Tag field</li><li>Widely used for defining recursive data structures (e.g. Trees containing Leaves and Internal Nodes)</li></ul></li><li>List</li></ul><h2 id="Curry-Howard-Correspondence"><a href="#Curry-Howard-Correspondence" class="headerlink" title="Curry-Howard Correspondence"></a>Curry-Howard Correspondence</h2><p>The Curry-Howard Correspondence, independently discovered by logicians Haskell Curry in 1958 and William Howard in 1969, states that “proofs in a given subset of mathematics are exactly programs from a particular programming language”.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="A-Brief-Introduction-to-Qt"><a href="#A-Brief-Introduction-to-Qt" class="headerlink" title="A Brief Introduction to Qt"></a>A Brief Introduction to Qt</h1><p>Qt is a C++ library with <a href="https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python">official Python bindings</a> that allows creating GUIs and cross-platform applications targeting different software and hardware platforms, such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, or embedded systems, with little to no change to the underlying codebase, while still having native capabilities, speed, and “look and feel”.</p><p>There are several advantages of using Qt, including:</p><ul><li>Well-designed object-oriented framework.</li><li>Excellent documentation.</li><li>Large user base.</li><li>Widely endorsed. Many industrial-grade cross-platform software use Qt, including Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max, Google Earth, Mathematica, OBS Studio, QGIS, Sibelius, Teamviewer, VirtualBox, VLC media player, Wireshark, and WPS Office.</li></ul><h1 id="Modules-Within-PySide6"><a href="#Modules-Within-PySide6" class="headerlink" title="Modules Within PySide6"></a>Modules Within PySide6</h1><p>To aid use, we have summarized the relevant modules of <a href="https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python">PySide6</a>, Qt’s official Python bindings.</p><ul><li><code>PySide6.QtCore</code>: Qt’s essential classes, including platform-independent command-line parsing, multithreading, date and time utilities, object serialization, etc. <strong>Most of these features have already been introduced into the C++ and Python standard libraries.</strong> However, we should pay attention to <strong>Qt’s event handling mechanism</strong> - a mechanism for emitting events in the form of objects across threads (known as signals), and handling these events in designated functions (known as slots).</li></ul><h2 id="Modules-Related-to-Building-GUIs"><a href="#Modules-Related-to-Building-GUIs" class="headerlink" title="Modules Related to Building GUIs"></a>Modules Related to Building GUIs</h2><p>The modules of PySide6 directly related to building GUIs are as follows:</p><ul><li><code>PySide6.QtGui</code>: Classes used internally by Qt’s user interface technologies, including classes for windowing system integration, event handling, OpenGL and OpenGL ES integration, 2D graphics, basic imaging, fonts, and text.</li><li><code>PySide6.QtWidgets</code>: <strong>Provides a set of UI elements to create classic desktop-style user interfaces. All UI elements, including user-defined ones, inherit from <code>PySide6.QtWidgets.QtWidget</code>.</strong></li><li><code>PySide6.QtMultimediaWidgets</code>: Provides multimedia-related widgets and controls.</li><li><code>PySide6.QtOpenGL</code>, <code>PySide6.QtOpenGLWidgets</code>: Used to support the OpenGL widget class, which operates similarly to other Qt widgets with the exception that it opens an OpenGL display buffer whose contents can be rendered using the OpenGL API.</li><li><code>PySide6.QtPdf</code>, <code>PySide6.QtPdfWidgets</code>: Classes for rendering pages from PDF documents.</li><li><code>PySide6.QtWebEngineCore</code>, <code>PySide6.QtWebEngineWidgets</code>: Provides a Chromium web browser engine as well as C++ classes to render web content and interact with it.</li></ul><h2 id="Modules-Related-to-System-API-Calling"><a href="#Modules-Related-to-System-API-Calling" class="headerlink" title="Modules Related to System API Calling"></a>Modules Related to System API Calling</h2><p>Qt is more than a GUI framework. It also provides a cross-platform way of doing a lot of stuff that desktop applications often need to do - calling into system APIs, especially platform-specific multimedia APIs not covered by the POSIX standard and&#x2F;or the C++ and Python standard libraries.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/31/10/multimedia-design-vector-4393110.webp" alt="Stock Image: Multimedia"></p><p>To better document this crucial yet often overlooked use case, we have summarized the relevant modules of PySide6.</p><ul><li><code>PySide6.QtBluetooth</code>: Enables connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices. Currently the API is supported to different degrees on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows.</li><li><code>PySide6.QtMultimedia</code>: Provides APIs for rendering audio and video files on screen and playing them back, as well as a thorough API for recording audio and video via system cameras and microphones.</li><li><code>PySide6.QtNfc</code>: Provides APIs for dealing with NFC Forum Tags and NFC Forum Devices, including target identification and loss, the registration of NDEF message handlers, the reading and writing of NDEF messages on NFC Forum Tags, and the sending of tag-specific commands.</li><li><code>PySide6.QtPositioning</code>: Allows developers to locate themselves using a variety of sources, such as satellite, wifi, text files, and so on. The position on a map, for instance, can be determined using that information. Additionally, it is possible to retrieve satellite data and carry out area-based monitoring. Currently the API is supported on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows (with GPS receivers exposed as a serial port providing NMEA sentences or using Windows.Devices.Geolocation).</li><li><code>PySide6.QtPrintSupport</code>: Offers broad cross-platform printing capability, including printing to attached printers, printing to remote printers over networks, and creating PDF files.</li><li><code>PySide6.QtSensors</code>: Provides access to sensor hardware. Currently the API is supported on Android, iOS, and Windows (MSVC).</li></ul><p>References:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-Pros-and-Cons-of-using-QT-framework-for-cross-platform-programming-Win-Mac">https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-Pros-and-Cons-of-using-QT-framework-for-cross-platform-programming-Win-Mac</a></li><li><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python">https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <title>Date and Time Types in Python</title>
    <link href="/2022/12/31/Date-and-Time-Types-in-Python/"/>
    <url>/2022/12/31/Date-and-Time-Types-in-Python/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many types in Python which can store date and time information. These types can be broadly divided into two categories:</p><h1 id="JSON-Serializable-Formats"><a href="#JSON-Serializable-Formats" class="headerlink" title="JSON Serializable Formats"></a>JSON Serializable Formats</h1><ul><li>UNIX Timestamp (e.g. <code>0</code>)</li><li>ISO 8601 String (e.g. <code>&#39;1970-01-01T00:00:00&#39;</code>)</li></ul><p>UNIX Timestamp has its roots in the system time of Unix operating systems. It is now widely used in databases, programming languages, file systems, and other computer operating systems. It counts the number of seconds that have passed since the Unix epoch began on January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC, minus any modifications made for leap seconds.</p><p>ISO 8601 is an international standard for the transmission and interchange of time- and date-related information on a global scale. Dates in the Gregorian calendar, hours based on the 24-hour timekeeping system, with an optional UTC offset, time intervals, and combinations of these are covered by ISO 8601. The standard offers a clear, unambiguous manner of expressing calendar dates and times in international communications, notably to prevent numeric dates and times from being misinterpreted when such data is sent between nations.</p><p>As the categorization suggests, these formats can be used in JSON serialization, and are widely adopted in data exchange formats and APIs. For example, Stripe APIs use UNIX Timestamps, while Twitter and Dropbox APIs use ISO 8601 Strings. UNIX Timestamps are easier and more efficient to handle, while ISO 8601 Strings have the virtue of being human-readable.</p><h1 id="Widely-Used-In-Memory-Data-Structures"><a href="#Widely-Used-In-Memory-Data-Structures" class="headerlink" title="Widely Used In Memory Data Structures"></a>Widely Used In Memory Data Structures</h1><ul><li><code>datetime.datetime</code> (e.g. <code>datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0)</code>)</li><li><code>datetime.date</code> (e.g. <code>datetime.date(1970, 1, 1)</code>)</li><li><code>pandas.Timestamp</code> (e.g. <code>Timestamp(&#39;1970-01-01 00:00:00&#39;)</code>)</li></ul><p>As the categorization suggests, these formats are in-memory, structured representations of date and time information.</p><p><code>datetime.datetime</code> and <code>datetime.date</code> are types implemented (and widely used) in the Python Standard Library. <code>datetime.date</code> represents a date (year, month, day) in an idealized calendar, which is the existing Gregorian calendar infinitely stretched in both directions, while <code>datetime.datetime</code> also combines the data from a time object (hour, minute, second, microsecond).</p><p><code>pandas.Timestamp</code> is implemented in <code>pandas</code>. It is the <code>pandas</code> replacement for <code>datetime.datetime</code>, and is the type used for the entries that make up a <code>pandas.DatetimeIndex</code>, and other time series-oriented data structures in <code>pandas</code>. Furthermore, it is also widely used across the Python Ecosystem for Data Science, such as being used by <code>matplotlib</code> as the <code>xticks</code> for plotting a <code>pandas.Series</code> with a <code>pandas.DatetimeIndex</code>, as shown below.</p><p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gLpr4.png" alt="`pandas.Timestamp` is the type used for the entries that make up a `pandas.DatetimeIndex`, and is used by `matplotlib` as the `xticks` for plotting a `pandas.Series` with a `pandas.DatetimeIndex`"></p><h1 id="Converting-Between-These-Types"><a href="#Converting-Between-These-Types" class="headerlink" title="Converting Between These Types"></a>Converting Between These Types</h1><p>With so many types in Python which can store date and time information, it is important to know how to convert between them.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Social media accounts are windows that exhibit our image to the public, and we must pay attention to them. However, on the one hand, the use of social media should complement, and not negatively affect, our routine work, study, and life patterns; on the other hand, different social media platforms generally differ in terms of appropriate content to display. After a period of observation and reflection, we have developed the following social media strategy to address these issues, as depicted in the Bipartite Graph below.</p><pre><code class=" mermaid">stateDiagramstate &quot;Life Moments&quot; as LifeMomentsstate &quot;Reflections on Life&quot; as ReflectionsOnLifestate &quot;Work Moments&quot; as WorkMomentsstate &quot;Reflections on Work&quot; as ReflectionsOnWorkstate &quot;Reflections on Development&quot; as ReflectionsOnDevelopmentstate &quot;Detailed Explanations&quot; as DetailedExplanationsstate &quot;Planning&quot; as Planningstate &quot;Instagram&quot; as Instagramstate &quot;小红书&quot; as XiaoHongShustate &quot;WeChat&quot; as WeChatstate &quot;QQ&quot; as QQstate &quot;LinkedIn&quot; as LinkedInstate &quot;Blog&quot; as Blog    LifeMoments --&gt; Instagram    LifeMoments --&gt; XiaoHongShu    LifeMoments --&gt; WeChat    LifeMoments --&gt; QQ        ReflectionsOnLife --&gt; XiaoHongShu    ReflectionsOnLife --&gt; Twitter    ReflectionsOnLife --&gt; WeChat    ReflectionsOnLife --&gt; QQ    WorkMoments --&gt; Twitter    WorkMoments --&gt; WeChat    WorkMoments --&gt; QQ    ReflectionsOnWork --&gt; Twitter    ReflectionsOnWork --&gt; WeChat    ReflectionsOnWork --&gt; QQ    ReflectionsOnDevelopment --&gt; LinkedIn        DetailedExplanations --&gt; Blog        Planning --&gt; Blog</code></pre><p>In addition, a pain point we will encounter is that we will post some content to both Chinese and English social media platforms. To overcome this problem, we can first write a Chinese (or English) version and use automated tools such as Google Translate and DeepL before manually touching up the machine-translated version.</p><p>Furthermore, to boost the following of our social media accounts, when we need to share the content posted on social media with others via private chat, we can share the link of the content posted to social media instead of copying and pasting the content itself.</p>]]></content>

The original paper can be found <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341301.3359638">here</a>.</p><p>This paper presents Thread Safety Violation Detection (TSVD), a tool that dynamically detects thread safety violations with low runtime overhead, and which is compatible with real-world, distributed-developed code employing different synchronization mechanisms. The tool frames thread safety violations as two methods, with one of them being a write operation, occurring concurrently. It infers thread safety violations using a very creative approach. First, it instruments the program and detects method calls that access objects behind thread-safety contracts. Later on, during the execution of the program, TSVD injects delays into threads with method calls accessing those objects and monitors whether another thread also accesses the same objects during the delay. As this may incur significant overhead, the tool uses two strategies to determine when to inject delays - keeping track of “near misses”, where the two method calls of two threads occur within a time threshold apart from each other, and inferring “happens before” relations, to rule out two accesses which are causally related.</p><p>The tool was tested on 43000 .NET programs in Microsoft teams, and its bug-finding capability outperformed both existing tools and configuring TSVD to emulate the strategies of existing tools, which shows the feasibility of TSVD.</p><p>There are two questions that come to mind after reading this paper:</p><ul><li>How does the tool acquire the information on which methods are thread-unsafe?</li><li>The approach the tool uses to infer thread safely - injecting delays and monitoring the behavior of other threads - sounds very interesting to me. Have there been any other applications of such an approach?</li><li>What is the sensitivity of the relevant parameters used in TSVD to its effectiveness and efficiency? Is there any guide on how to properly adjust these parameters?</li></ul><hr><p>Feedback from the Class Discussion</p><p>The proposed approach can handle different concurrency models, such as:</p><ul><li>async</li><li>task-based</li><li>thread-based</li></ul><p>But can it handle unstructured concurrency?</p><p>The approach generalizes data race for objects and data structures at the method-level (e.g. there cannot be two simultaneous calls to add() for a <code>List</code> class).</p><p>Using delays can handle many more cases than reasoning about thread scheduling. It is a “simple thing” which works for many cases (akin to fuzzing).</p><p>The approach requires manually specifying read and write APIs. Is it possible to create a semi-automatic approach starting from contracts labeled for standard library APIs?</p>]]></content>

    <title>Paper Review: Hybrid dynamic data race detection</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NOTE: This is a Paper Review for <a href="https://www.carolemieux.com/teaching/CPSC539L_2022w1.html">Topics in Programming Languages: Automated Testing, Bug Detection, and Program Analysis</a>. The original paper can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/781498.781528">here</a>.</p><p>The paper proposes a hybrid approach to dynamically (at runtime) data races in multithreaded Java programs. It first proposes two specific detection approaches, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The first is lockset-based detection, which identifies a data race when multiple threads use a shared memory location without holding a shared lock object. Such an approach is fast but may lead to false positives. As a result, the paper proposes another approach, happens-before detection, which uses several heuristics to reason about relations between events and infer whether a potential race has occurred at a particular memory location. In comparison, this approach is more computationally expensive and may lead to false negatives. Considering that neither approach is sound, they combine the two approaches by first using lockset-based detection to identify potential data races before using happens-before detection to reason whether these are probable. The paper then conducts an experimental study of their hybrid approach on various Java programs, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.</p><p>I like this paper’s idea of combining a pessimistic and optimistic approach when doing program analysis. Are there any other works that use such an idea?</p><p>However, I have a question concerning the applicability of the hybrid approach in real life. Although pessimistic, shouldn’t lockset-based detection be enough to stamp out all potential data races by providing programmers with feedback to add relevant locks to prevent such possible data races? This is relevant to the requirements for defensive programming. Or are there design patterns where multiple threads can safely use a shared memory location without holding a common lock and not lead to data races?</p><hr><p>Feedback from the Class Discussion</p><p>Difference Between Race Condition and Data Race:</p><ul><li>Race Condition: There are multiple threads, and the behavior of program depends on thread scheduling.</li><li>Data Race: Different from race condition. This frequently happens when you parallelize a program that shouldn’t be parallelized. Data race can be solved by using locks, but there may still be race coditions.</li></ul><figure class="highlight gams"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs gams">Thread<span class="hljs-number">-1</span>:<br><br><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">synchronized</span>(<span class="hljs-params">...</span>)</span> &#123;<br>    x = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;<br>&#125;<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure><figure class="highlight gams"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs gams">Thread<span class="hljs-number">-2</span>:<br><br><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">synchronized</span>(<span class="hljs-params">...</span>)</span>&#123;<br>    x = <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;<br>&#125;<br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Modelling in the Paper:</p><ul><li>Lamport Timestamps&#x2F;Vector Clocks</li><li>Thread events: statement executions in threads.

The original paper can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3213846.3213849">here</a>.</p><h1 id="Summary-of-the-Paper"><a href="#Summary-of-the-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Summary of the Paper"></a>Summary of the Paper</h1><p>The authors propose a methodology to detect out-of-bound array accesses statically. They first define that criteria that ideal techniques for detecting out-of-bound array accesses should satisfy, before analyzing the insufficiency of existing academic and industrial approaches, and presenting their own approach, Index Checker, implemented for Java.</p><p>Index Checker reduces checking array bonds to identifying 7 kinds of knowledge, which concern array index and array length, and form a hierarchy. It models such hierarchical knowledge as a Type System, requires the user to write “Type” Annotations at procedure boundaries, and verifies that values have the given “Type” at runtime. This is implemented using Checker Framework, an “industrial-strength, open-source tool for building Java type systems”.</p><p>The authors evaluate Index Checker on 3 large-scale, well-tested Java projects (Google Guava, JFreeChart, Plume-lib), and compare Index Checker with 3 other approaches (FindBugs, KeY, and Clousot), proving the effectiveness of Index Checker (scalability, finding bugs in well-tested programs, and low false positive rate). They also assess the burden of writing type annotations for Index Checker.</p><h1 id="Questions"><a href="#Questions" class="headerlink" title="Questions"></a>Questions</h1><ul><li>What is the rationale behind the 7 kinds of knowledge concerning array index and array length proposed in the paper?</li><li>I am not very familiar with Type Theory, which may have impeded my understanding of the value of the paper. What are the benefits of using Type Systems and Type Inference, and using Type Annotations to capture known constraints? Is it just to leverage the power of Checker Framework, an “industrial-strength, open-source tool for building Java type systems”, for sound inference? Or are there any further benefits?</li><li>No matter what the benefits are, from this paper, modeling hierarchical knowledge as a Type System, using Type Annotations to capture known constraints, and using Type Inference to verify such constraints sounds like a very innovative technique with many potential use cases. Have there been any other applications of such a technique?</li></ul><hr><h1 id="Feedback-from-the-Class-Discussion"><a href="#Feedback-from-the-Class-Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Feedback from the Class Discussion"></a>Feedback from the Class Discussion</h1><p>The hierarchy of knowledge is derived from Exploratory Data Analysis (trying stuff until it works, see Section 2.8).</p><p>“Subtype” is a kind of Comparable Partial Ordering (‘&lt;’). The Types in the Bottom have more information, while the Types in the Top have less information.</p><p>In Java, aside from Inheritance, another form of Subtyping is Function Subtyping. e.g. Comparator (to compare two Dog’s we can pass a function that compares two Animal’s) the inputs can be more general types.</p><p>Rules define what to do when a Pattern is encountered; however, it takes a (nontrivial) search to determine the order to apply the rules.</p><p>Fixed Point: Convergence of Information.</p><p>Reach a Fixed Point: Iterate until Convergence.</p><p>The Paper uses Subtyping to implement Widening.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NOTE: This is a Paper Review for <a href="https://www.carolemieux.com/teaching/CPSC539L_2022w1.html">Topics in Programming Languages: Automated Testing, Bug Detection, and Program Analysis</a>. The original paper can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2970276.2970321">here</a>.</p><p>A program usually accepts a formal language as input. Inferring the grammar of this formal language is an important task with many use cases.</p><ul><li>Helps humans understand the structure of the formal language.<ul><li>Manually writing valid inputs</li><li>Reverse Engineering</li></ul></li><li>Generate inputs for testing and fuzzing</li></ul><p>The authors propose Autogram, a method that infers a Context Free Grammar given a set of sample inputs and a Java program that accepts that set of inputs and uses it in some way. Autogram adapts a Dynamic Taining-based approach: </p><ul><li>It monitors the data flow of each character within the input, with “the Input Fragment it came from” as the taint.</li><li>It traces method entries, method exits, field accesses, and array accesses within the execution of the program.</li><li>From such a trace, the Dynamic Call Tree is reconstructed, and the sets of Intervals (Input Fragments) processed by functions, stored in variables, and returned by functions is derived.</li><li>This is used to build an Interval Tree, and the Interval Tree is refined into a Pure Input Tree free of conflicting overlaps (resulting from parsers using lookaheads).</li><li>The pure input tree is assumed to be a Parse Tree, and Production Rules are derived from it. The leaf nodes are considered to be Terminals, and Regular Expressions matching them are learned.</li></ul><p>The authors then conduct an experimental study concerning the accuracy and completeness of the inferred Context Free Grammars using “parts of the Java Standard API that are used to process URLs and property files”, and “open source projects that implement support for CSV, INI, and JSON formats”.</p><hr><p>However, I had more questions than answers after reading this paper.</p><ul><li>One of the use cases that the authors mentioned is “the grammar vastly simplifies the creation of parsing programs that decompose existing inputs into their constituents”. Why don’t we directly extract the parsing logic out of the program Autogram runs on?</li><li>The type of Context Free Grammar inferred by Autogram seems to be an LL(1) Grammar. This type of Grammar is only able to represent simple Grammars, and does not support for Left Recursion, which is pervasive in real-world Grammars. Why don’t they infer an LALR(1) Grammar, which is both simple and expressive (it supports representing may real-world Programming Languages). Perhaps, a Hidden Markov Model could be trained to infer the Transitions between the States within the LALR(1) Parse Table should an LALR(1) Grammar be inferred?</li><li>In the current implementation of Autogram, tracing is efficient, as the authors have mentioned: “millions of calls result in traces of a few Megabytes”. However, the current implementation incurs a ~100x performance overhead, and there is a lot of room for performance optimization. Maybe ideas that we have discussed for TaintCheck and Qsym (direct Binary Analysis, preinstrumenting Bytecode, JIT compilation etc.) could be used here?</li><li>The specific process of refining an Interval Tree into a Pure Interval Tree free of conflicting overlaps is not described clearly in the paper. Why don’t the author present an example with figures showing the manipulation of nodes within the Interval Tree during this process? The author also mentions applying “a simple heuristic that assumes left to right processing of the input” to resolve possible ambiguities associated with parsers using lookaheads. However, what is the rationale behind this “simple heuristic”?</li><li>The specific process of deriving Production Rules from the Pure Interval Tree is also unclear. What do the authors mean by “We can thus check if nodes are compatible and can be used to derive productions for for the same nonterminal symbol”? What is the meaning of “compatible” in this context?</li><li>The programs used in the experimental study are all open-source programs of very high code quality (containing accurately named variables and functions). However, how well does Autogram work with closed-source programs, and&#x2F;or programs with low code quality, containing obscure variable and function names? This is frequently the situation we encounter when we try to reverse engineer the (often closed-source and&#x2F;or obscure) structure of a program’s input, one of the major use cases of Autogram.</li></ul><p>Also some inspiration and ideas I got from the paper:</p><ul><li>The author mentions that “dynamic tainting allows us to precisely identify which parts of a programs input are read, stored and processed at any point in time”. Could this technique be used in a Fuzzing context to identify which bits generated by a Coverage-Guided Fuzzer are used in which sections of a fuzzed program?</li><li>The logic of building an Interval Tree is very interesting, and it reads like the “Subset Tree” mentioned in the KLEE paper. I conject that both these Tree Structures could be generalized and used in a much wider range of contexts.</li></ul><hr><p>Feedback from the Class Discussion</p><ul><li>A Context Free Grammar may not capture the structure of binary files.</li><li>How does the approach compare to unsupervised parsing in NLP or fine-tuning language models, especially with a lot of input?</li><li>Is it possible to use feedback to improve the mined grammar?</li><li>From one tree, we infer one set of grammar rules; from 1000 trees, we infer 1000 sets of grammar rules. They are merged together to derive the final Context Free Grammar.</li></ul>]]></content>

    <title>Paper Review: Dynamic Taint Analysis for Automatic Detection, Analysis, and Signature Generation of Exploits on Commodity Software</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NOTE: This is a Paper Review for <a href="https://www.carolemieux.com/teaching/CPSC539L_2022w1.html">Topics in Programming Languages: Automated Testing, Bug Detection, and Program Analysis</a>. The original paper can be found <a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/newsome2005.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>To combat worms spread by the Internet exploiting software vulnerabilities, the paper proposes TaintCheck, a dynamic taint analysis technique for automatic detection of exploits on software.</p><p>Summary of TaintCheck:</p><ul><li>TaintCheck directly operates on an arbitrary executable and does not require its source code. It uses Valgrind to translate basic blocks being executed into Valgrind’s RISC-like instruction set (UCode), inserts UCode instructions for instrumentation, and passes the modified UCode back to Valgrind for execution.</li><li>TaintCheck by default considers data originating from the network as “untrusted” and taints it. It keeps track of “the propagation of tainted data as the program executes”, which involves monitoring data movement instructions and arithmetic instructions, with the exception of constant functions such as <code>xor eax, eax</code>.</li><li>To accomplish this, TaintCheck associates “each byte of memory” with a Taint data structure. Different instances of such a data structure are “chained” to record “how tainted data is propagated”.</li><li>TaintCheck checks whether tainted data is used in ways it considers illegitimate, such as being used as a return address, a function pointer, a format string, and (optionally) as an argument of a system call. When such illegitimate uses are detected, it is possible to collect information about a software vulnerability, especially “the execution path from tainted data’s entry and its use in a probable exploit”.</li></ul><p>The paper also proposes a new semantic-based automatic signature generation approach on top of TaintCheck.</p><hr><p>There are several questions that came to my mind when I was reading this paper:</p><ul><li>The paper mentions that “the current implementation slows program execution between 1.5 and 40 times”, but also mentions that “the prototype has not been optimized”, and proposes optimization techniques. Why didn’t the authors implement these optimization techniques and conduct experiments on the optimized TaintCheck?</li><li>There is no doubt that using Valgrind to translate basic blocks being executed into UCode greatly simplifies dynamic taint analysis on an arbitrary executable, as TaintCheck deals with an RISC-like instruction set instead of raw machine code. However, this incurs significant overhead. Would directly performing dynamic taint analysis on machine code at runtime using a dynamic binary instrumentation tool such as Intel Pin boost performance (like the case of QSym)? What about generating UCode, inserting instructions for instrumentation, and passing the modified UCode back to Valgrind <em>before the executable is executed</em>?</li><li>What is the overhead of using the Taint data structure? Would the total size of all Taint data structures explode for long-running processes? And why do they use this Taint data structure, instead of using a conventional Data Flow Graph?</li><li>What is the list of constant functions that TaintCheck supports? Is it representative, and is it extensible?</li><li>Are the ways tainted data is used considered by TaintCheck to be illegitimate representative of real exploits? How well can TaintCheck discriminate from “illegitimate” uses with intentional uses, and&#x2F;or uses with checks? Specifically, the paper mentions that TaintCheck can “untaint the data immediately after it has been sanity checked”, but how is this situation detected?</li><li>In the evaluation section, why are the benchmarks used in assessing “compatibility and false positives” different from those used in assessing “attack detection” on actual exploits?</li><li>What does a “signature” look like, and how is it used to filter attacks?</li></ul><hr><p>Feedback from the Class Discussion</p><ul><li>Performance is not a priority. <strong>The paper is more of a proof-of-concept, and even “reads like a grant proposal”</strong>, especially Section 6.</li><li>The “taint data structure” includes more information than a dataflow graph (snapshots of the stacks etc.). It can also use a <strong>“memory arena”</strong> instead of vanilla heap allocation to improve performance.</li><li>Some of the detected attacks may not be present in “safe”, managed languages.</li><li>Due to the large overhead, the technique cannot be used to handle requests in production, but requests can be forked to it instead.</li><li>Dynamic taint analysis can have applications outside of the security domain.</li></ul>]]></content>

Dynamic taint analysis has been used to automatically understand the behavior of network protocols when given an implementation of the protocol.</li><li>Malware Analysis (analyze how information flows through a malware binary, explore trigger-based behavior, and detect emulators)</li></ol><p>However, there has been little effort to formally define them and summarize critical issues that arise when applying these techniques in “typical security contexts”.</p><p>The authors formalize the runtime semantics of dynamic taint analysis and forward symbolic execution by using SIMPIL (Simple Intermediate Language), which is “representative of internal representations used by compilers and is powerful enough to express typical languages”.</p><hr><p>Concepts:</p><ul><li>Statements: assignments, assertions, jumps, conditional jumps.</li><li>Expressions: constants, variables, binary operators, unary operators, get_input.</li><li>Execution state: the list of program statements, the current memory state, the current value for variables, the program counter, the current statement.</li></ul><p>Notation:</p><ul><li>$\Sigma$: list of program statements<ul><li>$\Sigma[v_1]$: statement at $pc &#x3D; v_1$.</li></ul></li><li>$\mu$: memory state<ul><li>$\mu[v_1]$: memory content at address $v_1$</li></ul></li><li>$\Delta$: register state (values of all variables)<ul><li>$\Delta[x]$: value of variable $x$</li><li>$\Delta[x \leftarrow 10]$: setting the value of variable $x$ to 10</li></ul></li><li>$pc$: program counter.</li><li>$\mu, \Delta \vdash e \Downarrow v$: Given memory state $\mu$ and register state $\Delta$, the value of expression $e$ is $v$.</li><li>$\Sigma, \mu, \Delta, pc, EXPRESSION \rightsquigarrow \Sigma, \mu’, \Delta’, pc’, {EXPRESSION}’$: Given list of program statements $\Sigma$, memory state $\mu$, register state $\Delta$, program counter $pc$, executing expression $EXPRESSION$ leads to new memory state $\mu’$, new register state $\Delta’$, new program counter $pc’$, and the next expression is ${EXPRESSION}’$.</li></ul><p>Other high-level language constructs such as functions or scopes can be easily represented using these constructs.</p><hr><p>Dynamic taint analysis tracks values in a program dependent on data derived from a “taint source” at runtime. As it is conducted at runtime, it can be expressed by extending SIMPIL.</p><p>Dynamic taint analysis is conducted in different ways (i.e., under different “taint policies”) for different applications. The differences lie in “how new taint is introduced to a program”, “how taint propagates as instructions execute”, and “how taint is checked during execution”. The author presents the example of the “tainted jump policy” for attack detection, points out several challenges it faces, and analyzes the proposed solutions.</p><ul><li>“Distinguishing between memory addresses and cells is not always appropriate”. An alternative “tainted addresses policy” could be used, but this may also overtaint.</li><li>Information flow can occur through control dependencies in addition to dataflow dependencies. This requires “reasoning about multiple paths”, while pure dynamic taint analysis “executes on a single path at a time”. Solutions include “supplementing dynamic analysis with static analysis” and “using heuristics”.</li><li>Taint is only added and never removed (i.e., “sanitized”), leading to the problem of “taint spread”, reducing precision. Well-known constant functions (i.e. using XOR to zero out registers in x86 code) can be checked. In addition, we can consider the outputs of some functions like cryptographic hash functions as untainted, due to limited influence of input on output. This can be quantified (Newsome  et al.) to automatically recognize such cases. Furthermore, values can be untainted “if the program logic performs sanitization itself” (e.g., index bounds checking).</li></ul><p>In conclusion, this paper is an useful introductory paper in forward symbolic execution and dynamic taint analysis, and I have mainly learned the following two things from the paper:</p><ul><li>The idea of formalizing runtime semantics using RISC-like bytecode</li><li>An introduction to dynamic taint analysis - what it is, what it can do, and what challenges it faces</li></ul><hr><p>Feedback from the Class Discussion</p><ul><li>What is the difference between a statement and an expression? A statement can modify program state when it is executed, while an expression doesn’t modify program state.</li><li>In the formalism of SIMPIL, we determine which expression to evaluate by <strong>pattern-matching the rule</strong>.</li><li>LLVM has a dataflow sanitization pass, which may be useful for implementing taint analysis.</li><li>Dynamic program analysis only looks at a single path. If we are to <strong>prove something about a program</strong>, static program analysis would be a better direction.</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NOTE: This is a Paper Review for <a href="https://www.carolemieux.com/teaching/CPSC539L_2022w1.html">Topics in Programming Languages: Automated Testing, Bug Detection, and Program Analysis</a>. The original paper can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2007.37">here</a>.</p><h1 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h1><p>The authors present Randoop, a feedback-directed random unit test generator for object-oriented programs which generates sequences of method calls that create and mutate objects, and uses feedback obtained from executing the sequences to guide the search towards new sequences.</p><h1 id="Logic-of-Randoop"><a href="#Logic-of-Randoop" class="headerlink" title="Logic of Randoop"></a>Logic of Randoop</h1><p>Randoop builds sequences incrementally starting from an empty set of sequences. In each iteration, it generates and executes a new sequence.</p><h2 id="Sequence-Generation"><a href="#Sequence-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Sequence Generation"></a>Sequence Generation</h2><p>First, it selects a method randomly among the public methods of classes.</p><p>Second, it finds arguments to provide to the method.</p><ul><li>If an argument is a primitive type, select a primitive value from a fixed pool of values.</li><li>If an argument is a reference type, select an extensible value of the corresponding type from a previously generated sequence in $nonErrorSeqs$ and put the previous generated sequence into a temporary list if possible, or select null otherwise.</li></ul><p>Third, a new sequence is formed by concatenating the sequences in the temporary list and the randomly selected method.</p><p>Fourth, the new sequence is checked whether it has been generated before. If so, the process is repeated.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors considers that repeated calls to a method may increase code coverage (e.g. reach code that increases the capacity of a container object, or reach code that goes down certain branches). Thus, with a probability $p &#x3D; 0.1$, instead of appending a single call of a chosen method, a maximum of $N &#x3D; 100$ calls are appended.</p><h2 id="Sequence-Execution"><a href="#Sequence-Execution" class="headerlink" title="Sequence Execution"></a>Sequence Execution</h2><p>After a new sequence is generated, each method call in the sequence is executed, and after each call, contracts are checked.</p><p>Default contracts checked by Randoop include:</p><ul><li>method throws no NullPointerException if no input parameter was null</li><li>method throws no AssertionError</li><li>o.equals(o) returns true and throws no exception</li><li>o.hashCode() throws no exception</li><li>o.toString() throws no exception</li></ul><p>If at least one contract is violated, the sequence is put in $errorSeqs$, and no values within the sequence can be extended. If all contracts are not violated, the sequence is put in $nonErrorSeqs$, and all values within the sequence are checked whether they can be extended. If the value has been encountered before, is null, or an exception occurs when executing the sequence leading to the value, the value cannot be extended.</p><h1 id="Experimental-Study"><a href="#Experimental-Study" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Study"></a>Experimental Study</h1><p>The authors evaluate the effectiveness of Randoop through three experiments.</p><ol><li>Comparing the basic block and predicate coverage of Randoop and five systematic input generation techniques on four container data structures used previously to evaluate these systematic input generation techniques.</li><li>Comparing Randoop with JPF (a systematic testing technique) and undirected random testing on 14 widely-used libraries.</li><li>A case study using Randoop to find regression errors between different implementations of the Java JDK.</li></ol><p>The experimental results strongly suggest that Randoop outperforms systematic and undirected random test generation in both coverage and error detection.</p><h1 id="Personal-Thoughts"><a href="#Personal-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Personal Thoughts"></a>Personal Thoughts</h1><ol><li>In my opinion, a key advantage of Randoop is the “sparse, global sampling” that it performs, which “retains the benefits of random testing (scalability, simplicity of implementation)”, while avoiding undirected random testing’s pitfalls (generation of redundant or meaningless inputs), and is better adapted to large-scale library code than the “dense, local sampling” of systematic test generation.</li><li>The sequences Randoop builds are akin to seeds in coverage-guided fuzzing, and I believe the efficiency and effectiveness of Randoop may be further boosted by applying a power schedule to the built sequences, much like applying a power schedule to the seeds in coverage-guided fuzzing.</li><li>The built sequences could possibly have overlapping prefixes. Would using a tree structure be better than storing each sequence on its own?</li><li>Randoop only supports a limited number of contracts, and its error-detection ability is rather weak. It may be appropriate on library code filled with assertions and checks, but may not work well on client code where these may be sparse.</li></ol>]]></content>

The original paper can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2011.42">here</a>.</p><h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>The pervasive use of inheritance, interfaces, and runtime polymorphism in object-oriented software systems leads to it being unclear which concrete method is invoked at a call site. Modern IDEs such as Eclipse offer static views of the source code, but provide little help in revealing the execution paths an object-oriented software system actually takes at runtime.</p><p>In this situation, developers usually resort to debuggers or profilers. However, the information extracted by such tools are volatile, and developers cannot continuously benefit from dynamic information integrated in the static source views in the IDE.</p><p>To solve this problem, the authors propose Senseo, an Eclipse plugin that collects dynamic information by running unit and&#x2F;or system tests of the project with a customized JVM, that enriches the source views of Eclipse with dynamic information, such as:</p><ul><li>which concrete methods a particular method invokes, and how often</li><li>which methods invoke this particular method</li><li>how many objects are allocated in methods</li><li>the dynamic collaborations between different source artifacts</li><li>a visualization of the system’s Calling Context Tree</li></ul><p>These are displayed in tooltips, ruler columns, the Package Explorer, and a dedicated Collaboration Overview.</p><p>The authors conducted an experiment with 30 professional Java developers solving five typical software maintenance tasks in JEdit, an unfamiliar, medium-sized software system, measured the time and correctness of the tasks, and conducted statistical tests on the measurements. Senseo yields a significant decrease in time of 17.5 percent and a significant increase in correctness of 33.5 percent, which validates the practical usefulness of Senseo.</p><h1 id="Personal-Thoughts"><a href="#Personal-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Personal Thoughts"></a>Personal Thoughts</h1><p>There is no doubt that the idea of enriching the source views of an IDE with dynamic information, as well as its implementation Senseo, is of great practical value to developers writing object-oriented software systems. However, I do have a few concerns after reading the paper.</p><ul><li>To enrich the source views of Eclipse with dynamic information, Senseo runs unit and&#x2F;or system tests of the project with a customized JVM. There are several concerns here.<ul><li>The project should have unit and&#x2F;or system tests that thoroughly exercise all units in a manner resembling an actual execution of the project in production, otherwise, the dynamic information for some units may be missing and&#x2F;or inaccurate.</li><li>The unit and&#x2F;or system tests should be self-contained and not rely on interacting with the environment, such as getting input from the user, using OS services, etc. If so, a possible remedy would be to carve unit tests from such executions.</li><li>There is significant overhead in the process of collecting dynamic information. As the authors have reported: “On average (geometric mean), CCT creation alone causes an overhead of factor 2.68. CCT creation and collection of dynamic information result in an overhead of factor 9.07. The total overhead, including serialization&#x2F;transmission, is of factor 9.47.” Although the authors claim that “even though the overall overhead is high when gathering dynamic information, we do not consider this a major issue as the application does not need to run at productive speed while analyzing it”, this could be a problem for lengthy system tests, especially if units in the system tests are frequently modified, and new dynamic information has to be reacquired. Carving unit tests from such system tests would also be a possible remedy.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Furthermore, aside from the idea and implementation of the tool, something else I appreciate and have learned from this paper is the experimental study, in which two measures, the time and correctness of the tasks, are selected, and statistical tests on the measurements are conducted. This convincingly proves the effectiveness of Senseo.</p>]]></content>

As the outcomes of these randomized algorithms vary greatly from run to run, assessing their effectiveness is an important topic.</p><p>To uncover whether randomized algorithms are properly assessed in software engineering research, the authors conducted a small-scale systematic review on three representative software engineering venues, namely IEEE Transactions of Software Engineering (TSE), IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) and International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering (SSBSE), in the year 2009. The review shows that the analyses “are either missing, inadequate, or incomplete”, and “randomness is not properly taken into account”. The authors then put forward guidelines for properly assessing randomized algorithms in software engineering research.</p><h1 id="Definitions"><a href="#Definitions" class="headerlink" title="Definitions"></a>Definitions</h1><dl><dt>Censoring<br>: a condition in which only the <strong>range</strong> (i.e. above a certan value, below a certain value, within an interval) of a measurement or observation is known, and its precise value is unknown.<br>: Akin to <strong>clamping</strong> in saturated arithmetic.</dt><dd>Commonly encountered in software engineering experiments when <strong>time limits</strong> are used.</dd></dl><h1 id="Assessment-Procedure-and-Guidelines"><a href="#Assessment-Procedure-and-Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Assessment Procedure and Guidelines"></a>Assessment Procedure and Guidelines</h1><p>A novel randomized algorithm is commonly compared against an existing technique. After determing a measure to compare (e.g. source code coverage, execution time), we should run both algorithms <strong>a large enough number of times independently (the author recommends “a very high number of runs” and not the rule of thumb of $n &#x3D; 30$ in medicine and behavioral science, as human aspects are not involved</strong>. With the collected measure data, we conduct the following:</p><h2 id="Statistical-Testing"><a href="#Statistical-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Statistical Testing"></a>Statistical Testing</h2><p>We use a <strong>statistical test</strong> to assess “whether there is enough empirical evidence to claim a difference between the two algorithms”.</p><p><strong>In such a statistical test, the null hypothesis is typically “there is no difference”, and we verify whether we should reject the null hypothesis.</strong></p><h3 id="Definitions-related-to-Statistical-Testing"><a href="#Definitions-related-to-Statistical-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Definitions related to Statistical Testing"></a>Definitions related to Statistical Testing</h3><p>There are two conflicting types of error when performing statistical testing: (I) we reject the null hypothesis when it is true, and (II) we accept the null hypothesis when it is false.</p><ul><li>The <strong>p-value</strong> of a statistical test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.</li><li>The <strong>significant level $\alpha$</strong> of a statistical test is the highest p-value we accept for rejecting the null hypothesis.

Performing a refactoring is not trivial, for which refactoring tools have been developed. Nevertheless, programmers do not use refactoring tools as often as they could.</p><p>To investigate this problem, the authors focus on one type of refactoring and one specific tool - the Extract Method tool in the Eclipse IDE.</p><ul><li>Fowler reports that Extract Method is “one of the most common refactorings”, “a key refactoring” which if successful, means “you can go on [to do] more refactorings”.</li><li>The Extract Method tool in the Eclipse IDE it is a mature, non-trivial refactoring tool.</li><li>Most refactoring tool user interfaces are very similar.</li></ul><p>The authors first conject tools are non-specific and unhelpful in diagnosing problems, and undertake a formative study observing 11 programmers perform a number of Extract Method refactorings on several large, open-source projects, which suggest that programmers fairly frequently encounter a variety of errors arising from violated refactoring preconditions.</p><p>The authors further conjecture error messages were conflated, insufficiently descriptive, and discouraged programmers from refactoring, and built three visualization tools within the Eclipse IDE as solutions. Then, they conducted a study to assess whether or not the new tools overcome these usability problems by comparing the accuracy and time to complete refactoring tasks with and without the new tools, and administered a post-test questionnaire for the subjects to express their preferences. The results of the study were very positive, and subjects found the new tools superior and helpful outside of the context of the study.</p><p>Finally, the authors provide recommendations for future tools.</p><ul><li>Code Selection: A selection tool should be lightweight, task-specific, and help the programmer overcome unfamiliar&#x2F;unusual code formatting.</li><li>Displaying Violated Preconditions: quickly comprehensible, indicate location, easily distinguishable from warnings and advisories, display amount of work required, display relations between precondition violations, distinguish different types of violations.</li></ul><p>The experimental study is very concise, and there are many aspects that can be borrowed.</p><ul><li>Undertaking a formative study to verify conjections about problems within current tools, before building new tools based on the verified conjections, and evaluating them.</li><li>The visualization comparing the the accuracy and time of <strong>each participant</strong> to complete refactoring tasks with and without the new tools is accurate and straightforward.</li><li>Using a questionnaire to acquire subjective feedback complimentary to an objective evaluation.</li></ul><p>However, there are still some flaws.</p><ul><li>Only one type of refactoring (Extract Method) and one specific tool was considered. The takeaways may not apply to other types of refactoring.</li><li>Several key variates were not controlled in the formative study, such as participants were free to refactor whatever code they thought necessary.</li></ul><p>Future directions of work include:</p><ul><li>Replicating the study for other types of refactoring.</li><li>Build and assess new refactoring tools with increased usability.</li></ul>]]></content>

Which technical innovations are most compelling to you?</h1><p>Concolic executors adopt IR in their symbolic emulation. Although IR makes implementation easy, it incurs additional overhead and  blocks further optimization. According to our measurement with real-world software, only 30% of instructions require symbolic execution. This implies an instruction-level approach has an opportunity to reduce the number of unnecessary symbolic executions.</p><p>Concolic execution engines use snapshot techniques to reduce the overhead of re-executing a target program when exploring its multiple paths. However, in hybrid fuzzing, test cases from the fuzzer are associated with greatly different paths, rendering snapshoting inefficient. Furthermore, snapshots cannot reflect external status, and solving this problem through full system concolic execution or external environment modeling is expensive and&#x2F;or inaccurate.</p><p>Concolic execution tries to guarantee soundness by collecting complete constraints. However, this can be expensive, and also over-constrain a path, limiting finding future paths.</p><p>To solve these problems, Qsym uses Intel Pin along with a coverage-guided fuzzer:</p><ul><li>Get input test cases and validate newly produced test cases (potentially unsound) from the fuzzer.</li><li>Employ instruction-level taint tracking, and only symbolically execute tainted instructions.</li><li>Generate more relaxed (incomplete) forms of constraints that can be easily solved (can result in unsound test cases, but quickly checked with fuzzer).</li><li>Fast execution makes re-execution much preferable to snapshoting for repetitive concolic testing.</li><li>Considers external environments as “black-boxes” and simply executes them concretely (can result in unsound test cases, but quickly checked with fuzzer).</li><li>Chooses the last constraint of a path for optimistic solving. It typically has a very simple form, and avoids solving irrelevant constraints repeatedly tested by fuzzers. <strong>This can be applied to other domains to speed up symbolic execution, if the domain has an efficient validator like a fuzzer.</strong></li><li>If a basic block has been executed too frequently in a context (a call stack of the current execution), Qsym stops generating further constraints from it. Extremely suitable for loops. <strong>This can directly be applied to other concolic executors as a heuristic path exploration strategy.</strong></li></ul><h1 id="How-are-those-innovations-evaluated-How-does-the-paper’s-evaluation-match-with-the-proposed-problem-statement"><a href="#How-are-those-innovations-evaluated-How-does-the-paper’s-evaluation-match-with-the-proposed-problem-statement" class="headerlink" title="How are those innovations evaluated?

We plan to overcome this limitation by improving QSYM to work with architecture specifications, rather than a specific architecture implementation. <strong>(Is taint analysis on IR+JIT also a possible solution?)</strong></p><p>QSYM currently supports only memory, arithmetic, bitwise, and vector instructions.

On the other hand, coverage-guided fuzzing tools such as AFL and libFuzzer randomly mutate known byte sequences to produce new byte sequences, and if the mutated byte sequences lead to new code coverage in the test program, they are saved for subsequent mutation.</p><h1 id="What-are-the-innovation-s-proposed-in-this-paper"><a href="#What-are-the-innovation-s-proposed-in-this-paper" class="headerlink" title="What are the innovation(s) proposed in this paper?"></a>What are the innovation(s) proposed in this paper?</h1><p>The paper proposes Zest, a technique for automatically guiding QuickCheck-like random-input generators to exercise various code paths in the semantic analysis stages of programs. It first converts a QuickCheck-like random-input generator to a parametric generator, which can generate a syntactically valid input from a byte sequence. It then uses a coverage-guided fuzzing technique with the parametric generator in order to produce syntactically valid input that can increase code coverage in the semantic analysis stages.</p><h1 id="How-are-those-innovations-evaluated-How-does-the-paper’s-evaluation-match-with-the-proposed-problem-statement"><a href="#How-are-those-innovations-evaluated-How-does-the-paper’s-evaluation-match-with-the-proposed-problem-statement" class="headerlink" title="How are those innovations evaluated? How does the paper’s evaluation match with the proposed problem statement?"></a>How are those innovations evaluated? How does the paper’s evaluation match with the proposed problem statement?</h1><p>The authors integrated Zest into the open-source JQF framework and evaluated Zest on five real-world Java benchmarks, comparing it to QuickCheck and AFL. They evaluated the three techniques on two fronts:</p><ol><li>The amount of code coverage achieved in the semantic analysis stage after a fixed amount of time.</li><li>Their effectiveness in triggering bugs in the semantic analysis stage.</li></ol><p>QuickCheck and Zest make use of generators for synthesizing syntactically valid input, and do not exercise code paths corresponding to parse errors in the syntax analysis stage. In contrast, AFL performs mutations directly on raw input strings, and spends most of its time testing error paths within the syntax analysis stages.</p><p>The experimental results suggest that when given QuickCheck-like random-input generators, Zest excels at exercising semantic analyses and is very effective at discovering semantic bugs.</p><p>The paper’s evaluation matches well with the proposed problem statement, as the experimental design accurately assesses factors directly correlated with the problem of “generating random, syntactically valid inputs to exercise various code paths in the semantic analysis stages of programs and leveraging feedback to generate new inputs via mutations”, and the experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><h1 id="Which-technical-innovations-are-most-compelling-to-you"><a href="#Which-technical-innovations-are-most-compelling-to-you" class="headerlink" title="Which technical innovations are most compelling to you?"></a>Which technical innovations are most compelling to you?</h1><p>The most compelling technical innovation is Zest’s design of generating a syntactically valid input from a byte sequence given a QuickCheck-like random-input generator, by using bytes from the byte sequence to “fill in” randomly generated primitive data types of various length (bool, char, int, etc.) required within the random-input generator. This allows bit-level mutations on byte sequences to correspond to high-level structural mutations in the space of syntactically valid inputs, enabling Zest to leverage the mature coverage-guided fuzzing algorithm originally designed for byte sequence inputs.</p><h1 id="What-remains-unclear-after-reading-the-paper-Are-there-any-clarification-questions-whose-answers-would-substantially-change-your-opinion-of-the-paper"><a href="#What-remains-unclear-after-reading-the-paper-Are-there-any-clarification-questions-whose-answers-would-substantially-change-your-opinion-of-the-paper" class="headerlink" title="What remains unclear after reading the paper?

How was the work validated?</h1><p>In his book on refactoring, Fowler catalogs 72 different refactorings, ranging from localized changes to more global changes, and Fowler claims that refactoring produces significant benefits.</p><p>Although case studies have demonstrated that refactoring is a common practice and can improve code metrics, they tend to examine just a few software products.</p><p>To help put refactoring research on a sound scientific basis, we replicate the study in wider contexts and explore factors that previous authors may not have explored. We analyze four sets of Eclipse IDE usage data and apply different several different refactoring-detection strategies to them. We then use this data to test nine hypotheses about refactoring, casting doubt on several previously stated assumptions about how programmers refactor, while validating others.</p><ul><li>Refactoring behavior of refactoring tool developers differs from that of their users. Specifically, RENAMEs and MOVEs are more frequent among users.</li><li>About 40% of refactorings performed using a tool occur in batches (several refactorings of the same kind within a short time period).</li><li>About 90% of configuration defaults of refactoring tools remain unchanged when programmers use the tools.</li><li>messages written by programmers in commit logs do not reliably indicate the presence of refactoring.</li><li>Programmers frequently floss refactor (interleave refactoring with other types of programming activity).</li><li>About half of refactorings are not high-level, so refactoring detection tools that look exclusively for high-level<br>refactorings will not detect them.</li><li>Refactorings are performed frequently.</li><li>Almost 90% of refactorings are performed manually, and the kinds of refactorings performed with tools differ from the kinds performed manually.</li></ul><h1 id="How-could-this-research-be-extended-How-could-this-research-be-applied-in-practice"><a href="#How-could-this-research-be-extended-How-could-this-research-be-applied-in-practice" class="headerlink" title="How could this research be extended?

How could this research be applied in practice?</h1><p>For the toolsmith:</p><ul><li>Most kinds of refactorings will not be used as frequently as the toolsmiths hoped. Improving the under-used tools or their documentation may increase tool use.</li><li>Programmers often do not configure refactoring tools. Configuration-less refactoring tools, which have recently seen increasing support in Eclipse and other environments, will suit the majority of, but not all, refactoring situations.</li><li>30 refactorings did not have tool support, the most popular of these was MODIFY ENTITY PROPERTY, performed 8 times, which would allow developers to safely modify properties such as static or final.</li></ul><p>For researchers:</p><ul><li>Questions still remain to answer.<ul><li>Why is the RENAME refactoring tool so much more popular than other refactoring tools?</li><li>Why do some refactorings tend to be batched while others do not?</li></ul></li><li>Our experiments should be repeated in other projects and for other refactorings to validate our findings.</li></ul><h1 id="What-were-the-main-contributions-of-the-paper-as-you-the-reader-see-it-How-does-the-work-apply-to-you"><a href="#What-were-the-main-contributions-of-the-paper-as-you-the-reader-see-it-How-does-the-work-apply-to-you" class="headerlink" title="What were the main contributions of the paper as you (the reader) see it? How does the work apply to you?"></a>What were the main contributions of the paper as you (the reader) see it? How does the work apply to you?</h1><p>Of particular interest to me is the inspiration for the hypothesis the authors verify - previous literature (frequently in other software engineering domains), personal experience, anecdotes from programmers, surveys. The benefit from this is twofold. First, it provides a source of inspiration for formulating hypotheses. Second, it endorses the validity of the hypotheses.</p><ul><li>We hypothesize refactoring behavior of refactoring tool developers differs from that of their users. Toleman and Welsh assume a variant of this hypothesis - that the designers of software tools erroneously consider themselves typical tool users - and argue that the usability of software tools should be objectively evaluated.</li><li>We hypothesize that programmers typically perform refactoring in batches. Based on personal experience and anecdotes from programmers, we suspect that programmers often refactor several pieces of code because several related program elements may need to be refactored in order to perform a composite refactoring. In previous research, Murphy-Hill and Black built a refactoring tool that supported refactoring several program elements at once, on the assumption that this is common.</li><li>We hypothesize that programmers do not often configure refactoring tools. We suspect this because tweaking code manually after the refactoring may be easier than configuring the tool. In the past, we have found some limited evidence that programmers perform only a small amount of configuration of refactoring tools. When we did a small survey in September 2007 at a Portland Java Users Group meeting, 8 programmers estimated that, on average, they supply configuration information only 25% of the time.</li><li>In Xing and Stroulia’s automated analysis of the Eclipse codebase, the authors conclude that “indeed refactoring is a frequent practice”. Although flawed, this becomes one of the authors’ hypotheses.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, some hypotheses are formed from a critique of previous literature, combined with domain expertise and&#x2F;or other literature.</p><ul><li>Several researchers have used messages attached to commits into a version control as indicators of refactoring activity. However, we hypothesize that this assumption is false, because refactoring may be an unconscious activity, and because the programmer may consider it subordinate to some other activity, such as adding a feature.</li><li>Past research has often drawn conclusions based on observations of high-level refactorings. We hypothesize that in practice programmers also perform many lower-level refactorings. We suspect this because lower-level refactorings will not change the program’s interface and thus programmers may feel more free to perform them.</li></ul><p>Additionally, much of the methodology presented in this paper can be borrowed.</p><ul><li>The fourth dataset used by the authors is Eclipse CVS, the version history of the Eclipse and JUnit code bases extracted from their Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) repositories. CVS does not maintain records showing which file revisions were committed as a single transaction. The standard approach for recovering transactions is to find revisions committed by the same developer with the same commit message within a small time window; we use a 60 second time window. In our experiments, we randomly sampled from about 3400 source file commits that correspond to the same time period, the same projects, and the same developers represented in Toolsmiths. Using these data, two of the authors inferred which refactorings were performed by comparing adjacent commits manually.</li><li>Ratzinger describes the most sophisticated strategy for finding refactoring messages: searching for the occurrence of keywords such as “move” and “rename”, and excluding “needs refactoring”. We replicated Ratzinger’s experiment for the Eclipse code base to nullify Ratzinger’s conclusions.</li><li>In order for refactoring activity to be defined as frequent, we seek to apply criteria that require refactoring to be habitual and occurring at regular intervals. First, we examined the Toolsmiths data to determine how refactoring activity was spread throughout development. Second, we examined the Users data to determine how often refactoring occurred within a programming session and whether there was significant variation among the population.</li><li>We hypothesize that programmers often do not use refactoring tools, because existing tools may not have a sufficiently usable user-interface. To validate this hypothesis, we correlated the refactorings that we observed by manually inspecting Eclipse CVS commits with the refactoring tool usages in the Toolsmiths data set.</li></ul>]]></content>

The original paper can be found <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>The author has been familiar with the observation that the quality of programmers is a decreasing function of the density of go to statements in the programs they produce, and in this paper, he explains why the use of the go to statement has negative effects.</p><p>He first remarks that the process taking place under control of the program, instead of the program itself, is the true subject matter of a programmer’s activity, and it is this process whose behavior has to satisfy the desired specifications. He then argues that our intellectual powers can better master static relations than visualize processes evolving in time, for which reason we should shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic progress. The author continues characterizing the progress of a progress, explaining that it can be uniquely characterized by a mixed sequence of textual and&#x2F;or dynamic indices, when conditionals, procedures, and repetition clauses are considered. However, the unbridled use of the go to statement has an immediate consequence that it becomes terribly hard to find a meaningful set of coordinates in which to describe the process progress, which will in turn “make a mess of one’s program”. </p><p>However, in my opinion, although the go to statement is considered harmful, abolishing the go to statement from all “higher level” programming languages is an overstatement. As the author himself stated:</p><ul><li>The exercise to translate an arbitrary flow diagram more or less mechanically into a jump-less one, is not to be recommended. Then the resulting flow diagram cannot be expected to be more transparent than the original one.</li></ul><p>There exist situations where an “arbitrary flow diagram” has to be implemented (especially when implementing Finite-State Machines in lexers, regex engines, and protocols), and in these situations, implementing the flow diagram using go to statements is much more direct, straightforward and easier to reason about (not to mention more efficient) than mashing up structured programming constructs.</p>]]></content>

The importance of such testing, combined with the difficulty and poor performance of random and manual approaches, has led to much work in <strong>using symbolic execution to automatically generate test inputs</strong>.</p><p>It has been an open question whether the approach has any hope of consistently achieving high coverage on real applications, facing the challenges in handling code that interacts with the environment, and the exponential number of paths through code.</p><p>Traditional symbolic execution systems either cannot handle programs interacting with the environment or require a complete working model. More recent work in test generation does allow external interactions, but forces them to use entirely concrete procedure call arguments, which limits the behaviors they can explore.</p><p>For the path explosion problem, search strategies proposed in the past include Best First Search, Generational Search, and Hybrid Concolic Testing. Orthogonal to search heuristics, researchers have addressed the path explosion problem by testing paths compositionally, and by tracking the values read and written by the program.</p><h1 id="What-are-the-innovation-s-proposed-in-this-paper-Which-technical-innovations-are-most-compelling-to-you"><a href="#What-are-the-innovation-s-proposed-in-this-paper-Which-technical-innovations-are-most-compelling-to-you" class="headerlink" title="What are the innovation(s) proposed in this paper? Which technical innovations are most compelling to you?"></a>What are the innovation(s) proposed in this paper? Which technical innovations are most compelling to you?</h1><p>KLEE interprets programs compiled to LLVM IR, and typically requires no source modification. It functions as a hybrid between an operating system for symbolic processes and an interpreter. Each symbolic process has a register file, stack, heap, program counter, and path condition. Unlike a normal process, storage locations for a symbolic process - registers, stack and heap objects - refer to expression trees instead of raw data values. The leaves of an expression are symbolic variables or constants, and the interior nodes come from LLVM IR operations.</p><p>Conditional branches take a boolean expression and alter the instruction pointer of the symbolic process based on whether the condition is true or false. KLEE queries the constraint solver to determine if the branch condition is either provably true or false along the current path. If so, the instruction pointer is updated to the appropriate location. Otherwise, both branches are possible. KLEE forks the symbolic process so that it can explore both paths.</p><p>The number of forked symbolic processs grows quite quickly in practice. KLEE implements the heap as an immutable map, and portions of the heap structure itself can also be shared amongst multiple symbolic processs. Additionally, this heap structure can be forked in constant time, which is important given the frequency of this operation.</p><p>Potentially dangerous operations implicitly generate branches that check if any input value exists that could cause an error. For example, a division instruction generates a branch that checks for a zero divisor. If so, KLEE solves the current path’s constraints to produce a test case that will follow the same path when rerun on an unmodified version of the checked program, and terminates the current symbolic process. KLEE will then continue execution on the false path, which adds the negation of the check as a constraint (e.g., making the divisor not zero).</p><p>The core of KLEE is an interpreter loop which selects a symbolic process to run and then symbolically executes a single instruction in the context of that symbolic process. Given more than one symbolic process, KLEE must pick which one to execute first. KLEE selects the symbolic process to run at each instruction by uses each strategy in a round robin fashion.</p><ul><li>Random Path Selection: Use a binary tree to record the program path followed for all active symbolic processs. A symbolic process is selected by traversing this tree from the root and randomly selecting the path to follow at branch points. This strategy has two important properties.<ul><li>Favors symbolic processs high in the branch tree. They have less constraints on their symbolic inputs and have greater freedom to reach uncovered code.</li><li>Avoids starvation when some part of the program is rapidly creating new symbolic processs (“fork bombing”) as it happens when a tight loop contains a symbolic condition.</li></ul></li><li>Coverage-Optimized Search: Select symbolic processs likely to cover new code in the immediate future using heuristics.</li></ul><p>This loop continues until there are no symbolic processs remaining, or a user-defined timeout is reached.</p><p>KLEE ensures that a symbolic process which frequently executes expensive instructions will not dominate execution time by running each symbolic process for a “time slice” defined by both a maximum number of instructions and a maximum amount of time.</p><p>KLEE uses STP as its constraint solver. KLEE maps every memory object in the checked code to a distinct STP array. This representation dramatically improves performance since it lets STP ignore all arrays not referenced by a given expression. Furthermore, there are tricks to simplify expressions and ideally eliminate queries before they reach STP, including:</p><ul><li>Expression Rewriting</li><li>Constraint Set Simplification</li><li>Implied Value Concretization</li><li>Constraint Independence</li><li>Counter-example Cache: Redundant queries are frequent, and a simple cache is effective at eliminating a large number of them. However, it is possible to build a more sophisticated cache due to the particular structure of constraint sets. The counter-example cache maps sets of constraints to counter-examples (i.e., variable assignments), along with a special sentinel used when a set of constraints has no solution. <strong>This mapping is stored in a custom data structure — derived from the UBTree structure of Hoffmann and Hoehler, which allows efficient searching for cache entries for both subsets and supersets of a constraint set.</strong> By storing the cache in this fashion, the counter-example cache gains three additional ways to eliminate queries.<ul><li>When a subset of a constraint set has no solution, then neither does the original constraint set.</li><li>When a superset of a constraint set has a solution, that solution also satisfies the original constraint set.</li><li>When a subset of a constraint set has a solution, it is likely that this is also a solution for the original set.</li></ul></li></ul><p>KLEE handles the environment by redirecting library calls to models that understand the semantics of the desired action well enough to generate the required constraints. The real environment can fail in unexpected ways. Such failures can often lead to unexpected and hard to diagnose bugs. To help catch such errors, KLEE will optionally simulate environmental failures by failing system calls in a controlled manner.</p><h1 id="How-are-those-innovations-evaluated-How-does-the-paper’s-evaluation-match-with-the-proposed-problem-statement"><a href="#How-are-those-innovations-evaluated-How-does-the-paper’s-evaluation-match-with-the-proposed-problem-statement" class="headerlink" title="How are those innovations evaluated?

How does the paper’s evaluation match with the proposed problem statement?</h1><p>Four sets of experiments are conducted.</p><ul><li>We do intensive runs to both get high coverage and find bugs on Coreutils and BusyBox tools, do a comparision with random tests and developer test suites, and discuss the bugs found.</li><li>To demonstrate KLEE’s applicability to bug finding, we used KLEE to check all 279 BusyBox tools and 84 MINIX tools in a series of short runs.</li><li>Thus far, we have focused on finding generic errors that do not require knowledge of a program’s intended behavior. We now show how to do much deeper checking, including verifying full functional correctness on a finite set of explored paths. We use KLEE to find deep correctness errors by cross-checking purportedly equivalent Coreutils and BusyBox tool implementations.</li><li>We have also applied KLEE to checking non-application code by using it to check the HiStar kernel.</li></ul><p>We chose line coverage as reported by gcov as a conservative measure of KLEE-produced test case effectiveness, because it is widely-understood and uncontroversial.</p><p>The results of the experiments are very positive, and convincingly prove the proposed problem statement.</p><h1 id="What-remains-unclear-after-reading-the-paper-Are-there-any-clarification-questions-whose-answers-would-substantially-change-your-opinion-of-the-paper"><a href="#What-remains-unclear-after-reading-the-paper-Are-there-any-clarification-questions-whose-answers-would-substantially-change-your-opinion-of-the-paper" class="headerlink" title="What remains unclear after reading the paper?

Are there any clarification questions whose answers would substantially change your opinion of the paper?</h1><p>Coverage-Optimized Search tries to select symbolic processs likely to cover new code in the immediate future. It uses heuristics to compute a weight for each symbolic process and then randomly selects a symbolic process according to these weights. How these heuristics work, which is critical for performance, is not symbolic processd, and remains unclear.</p><p>KLEE ensures that a symbolic process which frequently executes expensive instructions will not dominate execution time by running each symbolic process for a “time slice” defined by both a maximum number of instructions and a maximum amount of time. Precisely how this “time slice” is calculated is also unclear.</p><p>KLEE handles the environment by redirecting library calls to models that understand the semantics of the desired action well enough to generate the required constraints. These models are written in normal C code which the user can readily customize, extend, or even replace without having to understand the internals of KLEE. However, what “understand the semantics of the desired action well enough” means is unclear.</p><h1 id="Which-problems-remain-unsolved-after-this-paper-Do-you-foresee-any-barriers-to-the-applicability-of-the-technique-proposed-in-the-paper"><a href="#Which-problems-remain-unsolved-after-this-paper-Do-you-foresee-any-barriers-to-the-applicability-of-the-technique-proposed-in-the-paper" class="headerlink" title="Which problems remain unsolved after this paper?

Additionally, memory objects<br>are required to have concrete sizes.

Such testing requires specification of values for the inputs (or test inputs) to the unit. Manual specification of such values is labor intensive and cannot guarantee that all possible behaviors of the unit will be observed during the testing. </p><p>Several techniques have been proposed to automatically generate values for the inputs.</p><ul><li>Randomly choose the values over the domain of potential inputs<ul><li>Many values may lead to the same behavior and are redundant.</li><li>The probability of selecting inputs causing buggy behavior may be astronomically small.</li></ul></li><li>Symbolic Exection<ul><li>Addresses the problem of redundant executions and increases test coverage</li><li>For large or complex units, it is intractable to maintain and solve the constraints required for test generation</li></ul></li><li>Incrementally generating test inputs by combining concrete and symbolic execution<ul><li>During a concrete execution, a conjunction of symbolic constraints along the path of execution is generated. These constraints are modified and then solved to generate further test inputs to direct the program along alternative paths.

We analyzed common practices behind these decisions across the hand-generated representations, as well as the rationale behind the practices.</p><h1 id="What-were-the-main-contributions-of-the-paper-as-you-the-reader-see-it"><a href="#What-were-the-main-contributions-of-the-paper-as-you-the-reader-see-it" class="headerlink" title="What were the main contributions of the paper as you (the reader) see it?"></a>What were the main contributions of the paper as you (the reader) see it?</h1><p>In my opinion, aside from the obvious contributions of the paper presented by the author, there is a lot to learn from the study set-up and the conceptual framework for interpreting the results.</p><ol><li>To understand the rationale behind the practices, we instructed the participants to verbalize their thought process using the think-aloud protocol.</li><li>We distinguished practices concerning the type of content selected and the way the content was presented in a summary, because even summaries with content associated with the same part of the original fragment could vary on how to present the summary.</li><li>To make hypotheses justifying the use of different practices, we relied on a quantitative analysis of the distribution of each practice across code fragments and participants.

His work resulted in DDT, a family of program generators that conform to the C standard at various levels. However, DDT avoided only a small subset of all undefined behaviors, and only then during test-case reduction, not during normal testing. Thus, it is not a suitable basis for automatic bug-finding.</p><p>Lindig used randomly generated C programs to find several compiler bugs related to calling conventions. His tests are self-checking, but far less expressive than Csmith.</p><p>Sheridan also used a random generator to find bugs in C compilers. Sheridan’s tool produces self-checking tests. However, it is less expressive than Csmith and it fails to avoid undefined behavior such as signed overflow.</p><p>Zhao et al. created an automated program generator for testing an embedded C++ compiler, which allows a general test requirement, such as which optimization to test, to be specified.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-innovation-s-proposed-in-this-paper"><a href="#What-are-the-innovation-s-proposed-in-this-paper" class="headerlink" title="What are the innovation(s) proposed in this paper?"></a>What are the innovation(s) proposed in this paper?</h2><p>The paper proposes Csmith, a randomized test-case generation tool which generates programs that cover a large subset of C while avoiding the undefined and unspecified behaviors that would destroy its ability to automatically find wrong-code bugs. This advances the state of the art in compiler testing.</p><p>Csmith supports compiler bug-hunting using differential testing. Csmith generates a C program, a test harness then compiles the program using several compilers, runs the executables, and compares the outputs.</p><h2 id="How-are-those-innovations-evaluated-How-does-the-paper’s-evaluation-match-with-the-proposed-problem-statement"><a href="#How-are-those-innovations-evaluated-How-does-the-paper’s-evaluation-match-with-the-proposed-problem-statement" class="headerlink" title="How are those innovations evaluated?

How does the paper’s evaluation match with the proposed problem statement?</h2><p>The authors conducted five experiments.</p><ol><li>Finding and reporting bugs in a a variety of C compilers over a three-year period.

This has the advantage that no oracle for test results is needed. It exploits the idea that if one has multiple, deterministic implementations of the same specification, all implementations must produce the same result from the same valid input. When two implementations produce different outputs, one of them must be faulty. Given three or more implementations, a tester can use voting to heuristically determine which implementations are wrong.</p><p>How Csmith designs the results used for differential testing is also worthwhile. A Csmith-generated program prints a value summarizing the computation performed by the program, which is implemented as a checksum of the program’s non-pointer global variables at the end of the program’s execution. Thus, if changing the compiler or compiler options causes the checksum emitted by a Csmith-generated program to change, a compiler bug has been found.</p><p>Also compelling are the mechanisms that Csmith uses to avoid generating C programs that execute undefined behaviors or depend on unspecified behaviors, including performing incremental pointer and dataflow analysis in the process of generating programs.</p><h2 id="What-remains-unclear-after-reading-the-paper-Are-there-any-clarification-questions-whose-answers-would-substantially-change-your-opinion-of-the-paper"><a href="#What-remains-unclear-after-reading-the-paper-Are-there-any-clarification-questions-whose-answers-would-substantially-change-your-opinion-of-the-paper" class="headerlink" title="What remains unclear after reading the paper? Are there any clarification questions whose answers would substantially change your opinion of the paper?"></a>What remains unclear after reading the paper? Are there any clarification questions whose answers would substantially change your opinion of the paper?</h2><p>In the process of randomly generating programs, Csmith randomly selects an allowable production from its grammar for the current program point. To make the choice, it consults a probability table and a filter function specific to the current point: there is a table&#x2F;filter pair for statements, another for expressions, and so on. The table assigns a probability to each of the alternatives, where the sum of the probabilities is one.</p><p>However, how this probability table is constructed and maintained, which obviously is critical to generating high-quality random programs, is not stated in the paper, and requires clarification.</p><h2 id="Do-you-forsee-any-barriers-to-the-applicability-of-the-technique-proposed-in-the-paper-If-so-how-could-these-barriers-be-overcome-Which-problems-remain-unsolved-after-this-paper"><a href="#Do-you-forsee-any-barriers-to-the-applicability-of-the-technique-proposed-in-the-paper-If-so-how-could-these-barriers-be-overcome-Which-problems-remain-unsolved-after-this-paper" class="headerlink" title="Do you forsee any barriers to the applicability of the technique proposed in the paper?

If so, how could these barriers be overcome? Which problems remain unsolved after this paper?</h2><p>The most important language features not currently supported by Csmith are strings, dynamic memory allocation, floating-point types, unions, recursion, and function pointers. These are language features that are ubiquitous in real-world programs, thus, not supporting them is a serious barrier to the applicability of Csmith. The authors plan to add some of these features to future versions of our tool.</p><p>Although Csmith-generated programs allowed discovering bugs missed by compilers’ standard test suites, branch, function, and line coverage of the GCC and LLVM source code did not significantly improve compared to the compilers’ existing test suites. ‘Coverage-guided’ fuzzing may represent a future direction of research to discover more bugs lurking in unvisited sections of compiler source code.</p>]]></content>

How does this work move the research forward?"></a>What were the primary contributions of the paper as the author sees it? How does this work move the research forward?</h1><p>For large complex software products, there is a need to check that changes do not negatively impact other parts of the software and they comply with system constraints such as backward compatibility, performance, security etc. Ensuring these system constraints may require complex test procedures, but long tests conflict with strategic aims to shorten release cycles.</p><p>To accelerate test processes without sacrificing product quality, the paper develops a cost model for test executions based on historic test execution results that causes no test execution runtime overhead. The paper then presents a novel cost based test selection strategy, THEO, which skips test executions where the expected cost of running the test exceeds the expected cost of not running it, while ensuring that all tests will execute on all code changes at least once.</p><h1 id="How-was-the-work-validated"><a href="#How-was-the-work-validated" class="headerlink" title="How was the work validated?"></a>How was the work validated?</h1><p>The paper replayed past development periods of Microsoft Windows, Office, and Dynamics with THEO. THEO would have reduced the number of test executions by up to 50%, cutting down test time by up to 47%. At the same time, product quality was not sacrificed as the process ensures that all tests are ran at least once on all code changes. Simulation shows that THEO produced an overall cost reduction of up to $2 million per development year, per product.</p><p>Furthermore, this paper have convinced an increasing number of Microsoft product teams to explore ways to integrate THEO into their actual live production test environments. This further endorses THEO’s effectiveness.</p><h1 id="How-could-this-research-be-extended"><a href="#How-could-this-research-be-extended" class="headerlink" title="How could this research be extended?"></a>How could this research be extended?</h1><p>The paper stated that through reducing the overall test time, THEO would also have other impacts on the product development process, such as increasing code velocity and developer satisfaction. An empirical study on the effects of cost based test selection strategies on these aspects would be a direction for extending this research.</p><h1 id="What-were-the-main-contributions-of-the-paper-as-you-the-reader-see-it-How-does-the-work-apply-to-you-How-could-this-research-be-applied-in-practice"><a href="#What-were-the-main-contributions-of-the-paper-as-you-the-reader-see-it-How-does-the-work-apply-to-you-How-could-this-research-be-applied-in-practice" class="headerlink" title="What were the main contributions of the paper as you (the reader) see it? How does the work apply to you? How could this research be applied in practice?"></a>What were the main contributions of the paper as you (the reader) see it? How does the work apply to you? How could this research be applied in practice?</h1><p>In my opinion, the main contribution of this paper, and the aspect most able to be used as a reference in other projects, is the cost model where each test execution is considered an investment and the expected test result considered as return of investment.</p><p>Several factors are considered in the cost model, with their values easily derived from past observations.</p><ol><li>$p_{TP}$, the probability the combination of test and execution context will detect a defect (true positive).</li><li>$p_{FP}$, the probability the combination of test and execution context will report a false alarm (false positive).</li><li>$engineers$, the number of engineers whose code changes passed the current code branch.</li><li>$time_{delay}$, the average time span required to fix historic defects on the corresponding code branch.</li></ol><p>When a test is executed:</p><ol><li>$cost_{machine}$: the per-minute infrastructure cost of test execution.</li><li>$cost_{inspect}$: the average cost per test inspection, equal to inspection time times the salary of the engineer. For simplicity reasons, an average cost of test inspection is used.</li></ol><p>When a test is skipped:</p><ol><li>$cost_{escaped}$: the average cost of an escaped defect, per developer and hour of delay. Defect severity is not modeled, as it cannot be determined beforehand, and all defects causing development activity to freeze on the corresponding branch must be considered severe.</li></ol><p>After collecting these data, two cost functions are calculated: the expected cost of executing a test $cost_{exec} &#x3D; cost_{machine} + p_{FP} \times cost_{inspect}$, and the expected cost for not executing a test $cost_{skip} &#x3D; p_{TP} \times cost_{escaped} \times time_{delay} \times engineers$.</p><p>Through a reasonable and tested quantization like this, objective decisions can be made, boosting the efficiency of software development.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NOTE: This is a Paper Review for <a href="https://www.carolemieux.com/teaching/CPSC539L_2022w1.html">Topics in Programming Languages: Automated Testing, Bug Detection, and Program Analysis</a>. The original paper can be found <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/96267.96279">here</a>.</p><p>“An empirical study of the reliability of UNIX utilities” is the work that spawned research into the domain of software fuzzing. It proposes a technique later known as <strong>random fuzzing</strong>, testing the reliability of UNIX utilities by feeding them a stream of randomly generated characters and checking whether the program crashed with a core dump or hangs.</p><p>Although the technique is simple and is not a substitute for formal verification or testing, it is <strong>inexpensive and easy to apply</strong>. Its <strong>effectiveness in identifying bugs and increasing overall system reliability</strong> has been proven in many ways.</p><ol><li>It crashed 25-33% of the utility programs considered to be “reliable” on each platform.</li><li><strong>It was able to find recurring security bugs resulting from bad programming practices that even the best static analysis tools have limited success in detecting</strong>, including:</li></ol><ul><li>Accessing outside the bounds of a buffer</li><li>Dereferencing a null pointer</li><li>Unintentionally overwriting data or code</li><li>Ignoring return codes, especially error-indicating return codes</li><li>Faulty communication with subprocesses</li><li>Unintended interaction between modules</li><li>Improper error handling</li><li>Signed characters</li><li>Race conditions during signal handling</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><strong>Its relevance has remained strong over the years.</strong> Subsequent studies using the same technique showed that similar problems also existed within other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows. Even after thirty years, the utility programs in the modern Unix distributions of Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD are still crashing at a noticeable rate and not getting better, as evidenced in “The Relevance of Classic Fuzz Testing: Have We Solved This One?”</li></ol><p>The contributions of this work is <strong>multi-fold</strong>.</p><ol><li>As mentioned before, it proposed random fuzzing, an inexpensive, easy to apply, and time-proven way of finding security bugs which is complimentary with formal verification and testing.</li><li>It spawned research into the domain of software fuzzing. New fuzz tools usually take a gray- or white-box approach, diving deeper into a program’s control flow, and they have been applied to many new contexts. However, they often require more advanced specification of the input and&#x2F;or long execution times to explore the input and program control-flow space.</li><li>It provides revelations for software engineering: good design, good education, ongoing training, testing integrated into the development cycle, and most importantly, a culture that promotes and rewards reliability.</li></ol><p>Some personal thoughts after reading the paper.</p><ol><li><strong>Given the source code of a program and an input, what is the mechanism through which the researchers determine the position where the program crashes and hangs when given the input?</strong> This is mentioned in neither “An empirical study of the reliability of UNIX utilities” nor its sequel “The Relevance of Classic Fuzz Testing: Have We Solved This One?”, but is of great practical value.</li><li><strong>There is a surprising number of security bugs stemming from language defects such as not checking array bounds and dereferencing null pointers, as well as ad-hoc, hacky solutions to recurring problems such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, structured error handling, as well as graph algorithms including cycle detection, topological sort, etc.</strong> Personally, this is not my style of coding. I make extensive a lot of “safe” language constructs such as null coalescing, heavily exploit performant and well-tested algorithms within standard libraries and widely-adapted third-party libraries (such as boost in C++ and networkx in Python), and use theoretically sound tools (such as automatically generated LALR parsers for syntax analysis) in software projects. <strong>The efficiency, effectiveness, and practical value of these and other solutions, as well as how they can be improved, is an interesting question that comes to my mind after reading this paper.</strong></li></ol>]]></content>
