My name is Jifeng Wu（吴系风） and you can call me Abbas. I am a Computer Science Masters’ student at UBC working with Alexander J. Summers and Caroline Lemieux in the Software Practices Lab. I am interested in Programming Languages and Software Engineering. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering from School of Computer Science, Wuhan University. My bachelor’s thesis, “Effective Stack Wear Leveling for NVM”（《面向非易失性内存的栈空间损耗均衡方法研究》） has been advised by Qingan Li, and I have also done research in Graph Data Mining, advised by Yuanyuan Zhu. I enjoy computer programming (my favorite programming languages are C++, Python, Shell, and I am an avid Unix fan), photography, hiking, cycling, cooking, and language learning in my free time. If you are interested, feel free to contact me!"},{"title":"","date":"2022-10-20T19:50:53.140Z","updated":"2022-10-20T19:50:53.140Z","comments":false,"path":"tags/index.html","permalink":"https://abbaswu.github.io/project/tags/index.html","excerpt":"","text":""}],"posts":[{"title":"Various Solutions for Different Types of Reverse Proxying","slug":"Various-Solutions-for-Different-Types-of-Reverse-Proxying","date":"2022-10-30T07:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-10-30T19:19:16.192Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/10/30/Various-Solutions-for-Different-Types-of-Reverse-Proxying/","link":"","permalink":"https://abbaswu.github.io/project/2022/10/30/Various-Solutions-for-Different-Types-of-Reverse-Proxying/","excerpt":"","text":"Various Solutions for Different Types of Reverse ProxyingThere are some situations in which we have to expose a locally running web service to the Internet. This is know as Reverse Proxying. Depending on the situation in hand, there are multiple ways to do this: Server with Public IP AvailableIn this case, the Server is also known as a Jump Server. Client Accessible from ServerRun a port-forwarding tool such as socat on the Server. 1socat TCP-LISTEN:&lt;Port the Server listens on&gt;,fork,reuseaddr TCP:&lt;IP address of the Client&gt;:&lt;Port of the Service on the Client&gt; Client Inaccessible from ServerUse nat-tunnel on both the Server and the Client. Or, use Reverse SSH Tunneling on the Client. Reverse SSH TunnelingBefore TunnelingOn the Server: Update the sshd config file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config). Set GatewayPorts to yes. Restart the SSH Service. Make sure the Port the Server listens on allows Inbound Traffic. To TunnelOn the Client: 1ssh [-f] [-N] [-T] -R &lt;Port the Server listens on&gt;:localhost:&lt;Port of the Service on the Client&gt; [How you connect to the Server (e.g. `-i key-pair.pem &lt;username&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;`)] -f tells the SSH to background itself after it authenticates, saving you time by not having to run something on the remote server for the tunnel to remain alive. -N if all you need is to create a tunnel without running any remote commands then include this option to save resources. -T useful to disable pseudo-tty allocation, which is fitting if you are not trying to create an interactive shell. -R tells the tunnel to answer on the remote side. Server with Public IP UnavailableUse a commercial service such as ngrok on the Client.

No confidential information. Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB. GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100 GB per month. GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour. Implications: Static pages. Limit content of our personal website to text and lightweight multimedia, such as vector graphics and vector PDFs. Use raster graphics sparingly, and avoid heavyweight multimedia such as audio and video. Do not rebuild too frequently (&gt;10 builds per hour). FrameworkOur personal website uses the Hexo blog framework. Considerations: Support for GitHub Flavored Markdown. Easy-to-use CLI. One-command deploy to GitHub Pages. Support for two types of pages (Posts and Pages), adequate for a personal website. Huge library of spectacular, feature-packed and customizable themes.
