Since I happened to work in offices where I was the only intern, I was given the full responsibilities of a junior engineer, which was a rare privilege. Although I learned a lot of technical skills, I found the day-to-day work to be mind-numbingly dull.</strong> My coworkers were also unenthusiastic about their jobs, and there were few appealing prospects for career advancement. Of course, I'm not claiming that all engineering jobs are mind-numbingly dull; it just happened that the companies I worked for were not first-rate. Many of my college friends who interned at first-rate companies such as Microsoft had great experiences. Ironically, my first full-time job after finishing my Ph.D. was at Google. Google loved their experiences and signed on to work at those companies full-time after graduation.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Be careful when choosing an advisor.</li><li>Think about what you want to do, what that work is like, and how that aligns with mutual interests.</li><li>Consider the incentives of the advisors and collaborators.</li><li>A match in research philosophy does not imply feeling comfortable working together.</li><li>Be extremely careful working with people with a grind mindset.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I found a master's thesis advisor, and like any ambitious student, I began proposing my own partially developed research project ideas to him. <strong>My advisor patiently entertained my ideas but ultimately convinced me to focus on more conventional research topics that aligned with both his academic interests and, more importantly, the conditions of his grant funding. Since my master's program tuition was partially covered by a research grant my advisor had obtained from the U.S. government, I was obligated to work on projects within the scope of that grant.</strong> Therefore, I followed his recommendations and dedicated two and a half years to developing prototype tools for analyzing the runtime behavior of computer programs written in the C and C++ languages.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When I arrived on campus, Dawson was a recently-tenured professor who had been at Stanford for the past eight years; professors usually earn tenure (a lifetime employment guarantee) if they have published enough notable papers in their first seven years on the job. Dawson's main research interest was in building innovative tools that could automatically find bugs (errors in software code) in complex pieces of real-world software. Over the past decade, Dawson and his students built several tools that were able to find far more bugs than any of their competitors. Their research techniques were so effective that they created a successful startup company to sell software bug-finding services based on those techniques. <strong>Although I somewhat liked Dawson's projects, what appealed more to me was that his research philosophy matched my own: He was an ardent pragmatist who cared more about achieving compelling results than demonstrating theoretical "interestingness" for the sake of appearing scholarly.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>During my first meeting with Dawson, he seemed <strong>vaguely interested</strong> in my broader goals of making computer usage and programming more productive. <strong>However, he made it very clear that he wanted to recruit new students to work on an automatic bug-finding tool called Klee that his grant money was currently funding.</strong> (The tool has had several names, but I will call it "Klee" for simplicity.) From talking with other professors and senior Ph.D. students in my department, I realized it was the norm for new students to join an existing grant-funded research project rather than to try creating their own original project right away. I convinced myself that automatically finding software bugs was an indirect way to make programmers more productive, so I decided to join the Klee project.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even though none of my particular ideas managed to persuade Scott, he was still interested in collaborating with me to develop a project aligned with my broader interests. <strong>During that period, Scott held the position of an assistant professor, aiming to secure tenure at Stanford, and had been there for just three years. Consequently, he was eager to publish more papers as part of his tenure quest.</strong> As I was funded by a fellowship, Scott didn't need to allocate funds from his grants to support me, which made the collaboration appealing to him without any significant downsides.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In hindsight, I can now see why this project was likely to face challenges due to <strong>misaligned incentives</strong>, but at the time, I lacked the wisdom to anticipate such issues. I had decided to become a Klee assistant for Cristi and Dawson because I wanted to join an experienced older Ph.D. student and a professor who had a track record of publishing papers in their specific subfield. This approach had worked exceptionally well the previous year when I collaborated with Joel, an older Ph.D. student, and Scott, a professor, on their HCI project, which resulted in a top-tier, award-nominated paper.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So, what was different in this case? <strong>In short, neither Cristi nor Dawson had a strong urge to publish. They had already authored several Klee papers together, and a cross-checking paper co-authored with me would have been a "nice-to-have" but not an obligatory follow-up publication. Cristi was in the final year of his Ph.D. and didn't require further papers to graduate, while Dawson had already secured tenure and wasn't in a hurry to publish more. In contrast, Joel was a mid-stage Ph.D. student eager to publish the first paper of his dissertation, and Scott was an assistant professor who needed to publish prolifically to earn tenure.</strong> These two contrasting experiences taught me the crucial importance of thoroughly understanding the motivations and incentives of potential collaborators before embarking on a project with them.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Apply to fellowships before starting the Ph.D. for better academic freedom and advisor-advisee relationship.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I was also fortunate to receive two prestigious fellowships, <strong>the NSF and NDSEG graduate research fellowships</strong>. These fellowships were granted to only about five percent of all applicants. <strong>They covered the full expenses for five out of the six years of my Ph.D. studies and relieved me from the obligations of working on specific grant-funded projects. This was a significant advantage over students who had to work on such projects throughout their college years.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Applying to Ph.D. programs and fellowships during my master's year</strong> gave me a huge advantage over students who applied during senior year of college, since I had an extra year of research experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In other fields, such as the humanities and social sciences, students typically do not receive direct funding from their advisors. <strong>This distinction significantly changes the dynamics of the advisor-advisee relationship, turning the Ph.D. experience into more of a solitary journey and less of an employer-employee arrangement.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>However, I soon came to the realization that I wasn't obligated to remain tethered to Klee in any way, given that my funding came from the NDSEG fellowship rather than Dawson's grants. In contrast, all of Dawson's other students had no option but to persist with their work on Klee, as they were supported by his Klee-related grants. Therefore, I retained Dawson as my advisor but departed from the Klee project, embarking on the journey to create my own research project entirely from scratch.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Question each step in the decision-making process.</li><li>Have an outline or draft of the research paper, especially the evaluation section, before starting a research project.</li><li>This brings the obvious benefit of making research contributions.</li><li>It also forces everyone not to push you around, helping you to jump out of the "pecking order" slowly and surely.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Dawson believed that Klee could uncover new bugs that no automated tool or human being had previously discovered within the code of thousands of Linux device drivers. <strong>I recall thinking that while finding new Linux device driver bugs could be interesting to present in a paper, it wasn't entirely clear to me how these results constituted a substantial research contribution.</strong> To my understanding, my role was to use Klee to uncover new bugs, essentially applying existing research, rather than significantly enhancing Klee in an innovative manner. <strong>Moreover, I couldn't envision how my project would seamlessly integrate with the projects of the other five students for a coherent paper submission in March.</strong> Nevertheless, I had faith in Dawson's high-level paper writing strategy. <strong>Since I had recently joined the project, I didn't want to immediately question these decisions typically made by professors. I was assigned a specific task, and I was determined to carry it out to the best of my abilities.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My rational understanding acknowledged that experimental research in science and engineering fields often demands an extensive amount of unglamorous and labor-intensive work to produce tangible results. Ph.D. students, particularly those in their first and second years, are typically the ones tasked with undertaking the most tedious tasks—this is essentially what we are compensated for. In a typical research group, the professor and senior Ph.D. students formulate the high-level project plans and then delegate the responsibility of making all the intricate details function in practice to the junior students. First- and second-year students usually have minimal influence on the overall direction of the group's project. <strong>Although I fully embraced my position as the lowest-ranking member of the team, my emotional state still suffered significantly during those initial months because the work was exceptionally challenging and lacked immediate rewards.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I met with Dawson to express my frustration regarding the overwhelming task I was currently tackling. It felt ludicrous to spend several days configuring Klee for each new device driver. Not only was it physically exhausting, but it also didn't seem like genuine research. What could we possibly write in our paper? That I had devoted nearly 1,000 hours to manual labor in getting Klee to function with device drivers without gaining any meaningful insights? It didn't feel like a valuable research contribution; it seemed rather futile <strong>Additionally, panic set in as there were only five weeks left until the paper submission deadline, and Dawson had yet to discuss our group's paper writing strategy.</strong> Typically, writing a respectable paper submission takes a minimum of four weeks, especially when coordinating efforts among six students involved in the project.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>However, a significant problem arose. <strong>When we finally achieved those favorable results, there were only three days left until the paper submission deadline, and not a single word of the paper had been written yet.</strong> In such a short timeframe, it was physically impossible to write, edit, and refine a paper submission that had any chance of being accepted at a top-tier computer science conference. Nevertheless, we decided to give it our best shot.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>During the final 72 hours leading up to the deadline, Dawson and five of us students (one had dropped out of the project by this point) practically lived in the office, pulling two consecutive all-nighters to wrap up the experiments and draft the paper. Deep down, all of us students realized that there was virtually no chance that this paper would be accepted, but we followed Dawson's lead and pressed on.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>The result was a submission that can only be described as a disorganized mess – it contained numerous typos, nonsensical sentence fragments, graphics lacking explanations, and lacked concluding paragraphs.</strong> It was a dismal sight. At that moment, I couldn't fathom how I would ever complete a Ph.D. if it meant working in such a chaotic and haphazard manner. As anticipated, three months later, the reviews for our paper were overwhelmingly negative, filled with harsh comments like, "The program committee believes that this paper is far too sloppily prepared to warrant acceptance; please refrain from submitting papers that are clearly unready for review."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>My friend Greg, who was one of Rob's Ph.D. students, emphasized the significance of the third point: <strong>thinking about experiments when suggesting research project ideas</strong>. <strong>Professors are often driven by the desire to have their names associated with published papers, and in the field of computer science, conference papers typically require robust experiments to secure acceptance for publication.</strong> Therefore, it's essential to consider experiment design right from the outset when formulating project proposals.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Target fellow researchers with similar incentives when conducting HCI studies in academia.</li><li>Without exceptionally strong resources, find a novel niche for research instead of an overcrowded and highly competitive domain.</li><li>Do not attempt to do in academia what should be done in industry.</li></ul><blockquote><p>In hindsight, I'm not astonished that my efforts to shadow professionals in their workplaces were unsuccessful. I had nothing to contribute to these seasoned programmers; my presence would have likely disrupted their workday. <strong>Fortunately, a few years later, I had the opportunity to observe a different group of programmers—fellow graduate students engaged in programming for scientific research. They were open to my occasional inquiries and more than willing to discuss their working environments.</strong> These interviews would ultimately serve as a direct source of inspiration for my dissertation work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Dawson and I encountered significant challenges in getting our research results published. Over the course of a year, we submitted two papers that were both rejected. It would take another full year before our work was finally published as a shorter-length paper in a second-tier conference, which held minimal prestige and did not count as a contribution to my dissertation. However, by that point, I had already moved on to other projects.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The primary reason behind our struggles with publication was that we were not considered "insiders" in the empirical software measurement subfield (sometimes referred to as empirical software engineering), to which our project belonged. When Dawson and I embarked on this work, numerous research teams from various universities and corporate research labs were already engaged in similar endeavors. <strong>We were clearly outmatched by the competition, which included professors and research scientists specializing in empirical software measurement, guiding armies of Ph.D. students through the extensive data analysis. These individuals were eager to publish a multitude of papers, especially young professors aspiring to attain tenure. They possessed expertise in statistical methodologies, framing related work, and crafting persuasive narratives needed to secure acceptance for such papers. Most significantly, they frequently served on program committees and acted as external reviewers for relevant conferences, which provided them with in-depth knowledge of the requisites for producing publishable papers in this subfield.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Find a meaning for your research and build a reputation.</li></ul><blockquote><p>After two months of persistent effort, I began to achieve some modest victories. I managed to get Klee to function well enough to identify my first few bugs in the smallest device drivers. <strong>To ascertain whether these bugs were genuine (as opposed to false positives resulting from Klee's limitations), I sent emails outlining each potential bug to the Linux developers responsible for those drivers. Several driver creators verified that I had indeed discovered real bugs in their code. These email confirmations brought me great excitement, as they represented my initial glimpses of external validation.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The skill of crafting concise and impactful professional emails has proven to be highly beneficial for my career.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Raise encountered problems and frustrations, no matter how minor, at meetings and complain.</li><li>Actively contact people for feedback, motivation, and emotional support.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I found myself navigating unfamiliar territory, making it significantly more challenging to seek assistance compared to my undergraduate years when solutions were more straightforward. As the sole person working with Klee on device driver code, my colleagues couldn't offer much guidance. <strong>While Dawson occasionally provided high-level strategic advice, as is customary for tenured professors, his role didn't involve being directly involved in the day-to-day challenges we faced. It fell upon us, the students, to decipher all the intricate details necessary to yield results—my task being to uncover new bugs in Linux device drivers that had not been previously identified. Professors often reiterate the mantra, "If it's already been done before, then it wouldn't be research!"</strong> For the first time, I truly grasped the essence of those words.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For the following ten weeks, I found myself daydreaming about my own research concepts in complete isolation, without engaging in any conversations with others. Given my negative initial experience working in a research group over the past few months, I craved solitude to think independently. Dawson was supportive of my absence since he wasn't financially supporting me through his grants.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I lived in complete seclusion, mentally drained but still attempting to make gradual progress. Each day, I dedicated myself to reading numerous computer science research papers and taking notes in the hope of finding inspiration for my own creative ideas. However, lacking proper guidance or context, I often ended up squandering a lot of time without gaining meaningful insights from my readings. I also roamed aimlessly on my bicycle through the neighborhoods around campus, hoping to spark new research ideas to no avail. Most notably, I procrastinated more than I ever had in my life up to that point: I watched countless TV shows, took numerous naps, and wasted countless hours online. Unlike my friends with conventional nine-to-five jobs, there was no supervisor monitoring my daily activities, so I allowed my mind to wander without any structure in my life.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>During those ten solitary weeks, I scarcely spoke to anyone, not even my friends or family. Complaining seemed futile because it felt like nobody could truly grasp what I was going through at the time. My friends who were not pursuing Ph.D. programs believed I was simply "in school" and taking classes like a typical student. Meanwhile, the few friends I had made in my department were grappling with their own first-year Ph.D. struggles, primarily the shock of diving headfirst into complex, open-ended research problems without the ability to influence the overarching direction of their assigned projects. We, as young computer scientists, willingly engaged in tasks that were both exceptionally challenging and seemingly devoid of purpose, all while earning a quarter of the salary of our friends in the corporate world. It was so disheartening that it became almost comically tragic. <strong>However, I didn't believe that group complaining would be productive, so I chose to remain silent. I avoided the Computer Science Department building, fearing encounters with colleagues who might inevitably inquire about my work, and I had no respectable response to offer. Instead, I preferred secluding myself in libraries and coffee shops.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In hindsight, going solo so early in my graduate school journey was a regrettable decision. Contrary to romanticized notions of a solitary scholar sitting outdoors, sipping a latte, and scribbling on blank notebook pages, real research is never conducted in isolation. It necessitates a solid foundation in intellectual, historical, and sometimes even physical aspects (such as laboratory equipment) to develop innovative ideas. <strong>A wiser approach during those weeks would have been to communicate with Dawson more frequently and actively seek collaborations with other professors or senior students. However, at that time, I was so burnt out and frustrated with the traditional hierarchy of group-based research – which often involved new Ph.D. students performing the most unglamorous tasks – that I retreated and embarked on my own path.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>By the middle of my third year, many of my fellow students and I found ourselves in a state of "limbo." <strong>It became increasingly challenging to muster the motivation to come into the office day in and day out. We also grappled with feelings of isolation and loneliness, as we spent our days and nights immersed in tackling obscure, highly specialized problems that few people in our immediate surroundings comprehended or showed interest in.</strong> While our advisors and senior colleagues occasionally offered high-level guidance, they seldom sat down with us to work through the intricate details of our research endeavors.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Actively expand your network and seek collaboration opportunities.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Just before commencing my second year of the Ph.D. program in September 2007, I took a one-week vacation to Boston to visit friends from college. While in the area, I reached out to a few MIT professors I knew from my undergraduate years, seeking their guidance. During our meetings, they all conveyed a similar message: <strong>Take the initiative to engage with professors, explore research topics of mutual interest, and above all, avoid isolation.</strong> This straightforward advice, consistently applied over the next five years, ultimately paved the way for a successful completion of my Ph.D. journey.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I wasted no time in taking this advice to heart while still in Boston. I sent a cold email to an MIT computer science professor named Rob, politely requesting a meeting with him. In this initial email, I briefly introduced myself as a recent MIT graduate and a current Stanford Ph.D. student with a keen interest in developing tools to enhance the productivity of computer programmers. Given that I knew Rob shared an interest in this research area, I hoped my email would pique his interest rather than end up in his spam folder. Fortunately, Rob generously agreed to meet with me for an hour in his office, during which I presented a few project proposals and sought his feedback. He appeared to find merit in my ideas, which bolstered my confidence that they held promise in the eyes of a professor working in this research domain. Regrettably, I couldn't collaborate with Rob as I was no longer an MIT student. <strong>Nonetheless, at the conclusion of our meeting, Rob suggested that I approach a Stanford computer science professor named Scott to see if I could garner his interest in my ideas.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Optimize the process of note-taking for research.</li></ul><blockquote><p>My daily routine primarily revolved around the development of computer programs designed to extract, clean, reformat, and analyze data from the Linux revision control history and the 2,000 bug reports. <strong>In my pursuit of gaining insights, I independently acquired a foundational understanding of quantitative data analysis, statistics, and data visualization techniques. Throughout my work, I meticulously recorded my experimental progress in a research lab notebook, carefully documenting which trials were successful and which were not.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every week or so, I would meet with Dawson to present my findings. <strong>Typically, these meetings involved me presenting him with printouts of graphs or data tables generated through my analyses, followed by him offering high-level suggestions, such as, "This part of the graph appears unusual; can you explain why? Try breaking down the data in this manner and delve deeper."</strong> It was only years later that I discovered this working style was relatively common among computational researchers in various academic disciplines. For my dissertation, I went on to develop tools aimed at streamlining the typical inefficiencies in this prevalent workflow. However, at that time, I had no such long-term vision; my primary goal was to make intriguing discoveries and have them published.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>Research software tend to be rough prototypes. Keep them simple, stupid.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Similar to other sophisticated software tools, Klee featured numerous configurable options. However, since it was a research prototype assembled by students, most of these options lacked clear documentation regarding their behaviors.</strong> Consequently, I spent a significant amount of time grappling with misunderstandings about the subtle interactions between these options as I adjusted them. My research lab notebook became filled with frustrations, including entries like: "OH SH*T, I believe my mistake was failing to realize that there are specific options meant to be passed into Klee (e.g., -emit-all-errors), and others that should be passed into the target program to set up the model environment (e.g., --sym-args). When these get confused, bizarre outcomes occur because Klee ends up executing the target program with argc and argv values that differ from what you'd expect."</p></blockquote></div><hr><div><div
